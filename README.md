# 8-bit ALU Project
Implementation of a structurally designed 8-bit ALU using Verilog with ModelSim.

## Folder Structure
- `docs/` contains all of the documentation for the project.
- `src/` contains the ALU and its components (adder, multiplier, etc.).
- `src/arithmetic_unit` contains components of the Arithmetic Unit.
- `src/control_unit` contains components of the Control Unit.
- `src/mux` contains MUX unit.
- `src/registers` contains register unit.
- `testbenches/` contains testbenches for verifying functionality.

## Getting Started
1. Compile the Verilog files.
2. Run testbenches to verify functionality.
3. Simulate using ModelSim or a similar tool.
