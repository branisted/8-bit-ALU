# 8-bit ALU Project
This project implements a structurally designed 8-bit ALU using Verilog.

## Folder Structure
- `src/` contains the ALU and its components (adder, multiplier, etc.).
- `testbenches/` contains testbenches for verifying functionality.
- `simulations/` stores waveform images and results.
- `scripts/` can include ModelSim or other automation scripts.

## Getting Started
1. Compile the Verilog files.
2. Run testbenches to verify functionality.
3. Simulate using ModelSim or a similar tool.
