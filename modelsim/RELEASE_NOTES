   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * Dragging the wave slider could cause a crash. The problem has been
       fixed.
     * The help menu and toolbar fails to access the HTML documents on the
       Windows platform. This issue has been fixed.
     * Extremely long dataset names (> 80 characters) could cause a crash when
       a virtual signal was created.
     * The  simulator  could  crash  if  waveform  comparison was done on
       SystemVerilog string variables. This has been corrected.
     * When  using  Codelink  or any design that adds items to the design
       structure via an FLI call during simulation, the U/I may crash if the
       Objects window Value column is set as the sort column. This issue has
       been resolved.
     * The Restart dialog would fail to appear if you tried to open it from an
       undocked window with the main session window iconified. This has been
       fixed.
     * Analog formatted waveforms could lose their min/max settings following a
       restart. This problem has been fixed.
     * An error could cause waveforms of busy signals to stick at the same
       value for an interval of time, zooming in would reveal the correct
       values. This error has been fixed.
     * Waveform compare failed for complex escaped identifiers in signal paths.
     * User defined radix did not work with hexadecimal numbers larger than
       32-bits. This issue is now fixed.
     * The Verification Management Tracker window allows filtering which can be
       invoke  with  the "Filter" -> "Apply" menu. This menu did not work
       correctly in the "Tools" menu in the undocked window or the RMB popup
       menu after a second .ucdb file was opened. This has been fixed.
     * After clicking on an attribute value in the Verification Management
       Tracker window to edit it, if the user typed the escape key (to back out
       of rather than save any changes) an error resulted and the original
       value was lost. This has been fixed.
     * The Verification Management Tracker window could not cope with spaces in
       the names of attributes and therefore in the column header names. It
       used only the first word of the name and also muddled the column data.
       This has been fixed.
     * Loading source object database performance has been enhanced.
     * The parsing of the argument file by using the -f command line option
       behaves differently when called from shell prompt vs. the vsim prompt.
       This issue is now fixed.
     * Several of the CLI coverage commands, coverage tag, coverage analyze,
       coverage clear, and coverage unlinked, used the option -recurse instead
       of -recursive in at least one of:
         1. the reference manual,
         2. the command completion help in the GUI,
         3. the usage message, or
         4. the parsing of the command.
       Now  -recursive is used consistently throughout for all of the CLI
       coverage commands.
     * Using an invalid option with the coverage clear CLI command (example:
       coverage clear -bogus) caused a crash. This has been fixed.
     * The U/I will loose keyboard focus, appearing to be unresponsive, until
       the focus is directed to another application and back again. This will
       happen when a window pane is close, and possibly under other conditions.
       This issue has been resolved.
     * Nologging any Verilog signal with WLF threads enabled could result in a
       crash. The problem showed up for a customer logging with:
       log -r /*; nolog -all
       The error has been corrected.
     * The display of signals when zoomed out was sometimes incorrect. The
       correct  view  would appear after zooming in. The problem has been
       corrected.
     * A signal was displayed incorrectly when zoomed out, showing a gap of no
       activity where the signal was active. Zooming in showed the correct
       view. The error has been corrected.
     * Verilog arrays of nets were sometimes displayed incorrectly in the Wave
       window. After an interval of time, the display would show the values for
       the array elements as 'X' even though new values had been set. The error
       has been fixed.
     * Creating a Wave window group using the wave group command or the wave
       group dialog did not preserve the properties (e.g. color, radix, etc.)
       on the signals being grouped.
     * Several Wave window group height related issues have been resolved
       including:
          + group item height changing on restart,
          + height switch on add wave command not working for groups,
          + grouping of objects of different height could cause the height of
            the group item to be incorrect.
     * Several Wave window group issues regarding nested groups have been
       addressed including:
          + deleting a nested group caused parent group failure,
          + not being able to create a group containing selected groups using
            the popup "Group..." menu selection,
          + not being able to create nested groups with the wave group command,
          + creating a nested wave group would always put the new group at the
            end of the parent group.
          + ungrouping a nested group would destabilize the parent group.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * A module description starting within a `include file, but completed
       after returning from the `include, would sometimes associate a wrong or
       non-existent  source file with subsequent declarations. This would
       sometimes be exhibited by a vopt internal error: ** Error: name.v(12):
       Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vl_cpyidl.c(262) obj < maxFiles
     * Support for the -source option to the Verilog compiler and/or vopt would
       neglect to close files when consecutive errors occurred within the same
       file, but on subsequently decreasing line numbers. Eventually, the
       compiler might exit with an error message similar to: ** Error: (vopt-7)
       Failed to open file "filename" in w+ mode. Too many open files. (errno =
       EMFILE)
     * vlog's -E switch would incorrectly write tabs as '\t' to the output
       file.
     * Use of +nospecify on the vsim command line with optimized gate-level
       cells could crash the simulation.
     * An event on a class variable could result in a memory leak. This problem
       started occurring in 6.5 and is now fixed in 6.5b.
     * Loading multiple instances of the same design unit in Verilog and using
       a Verilog configuration or `uselib to specify one of the instances be a
       different type of design unit could cause a crash, unexpected errors, or
       unexpected simulation results depending on the type of design unit.
       Specifying a VHDL design unit when a Verilog module is expected or
       specifying a Verilog design unit when VHDL is expected would cause a
       crash. Specifying a UDP in place of a module could cause unexpected
       errors for port connectivity. Specifying a program block when a module
       was expected could cause statements executing in the module instances to
       execute in the reactive region.
     * Fixed spurious error about X or Z values during randomization of 2-state
       enumerated type variables.
     * Detected loading error #3609 for forward hierarchical reference to
       optimized cell port from SystemVerilog interface.
     * When three or more bind packages are specified on the vsim command line,
       vsim will hang. This issue has been resolved.
     * The  simulator had incorrectly set real values to zero on implicit
       conversion in Verilog simulations.
     * In some cases involving sign extension, generate condition or loop
       conditions could be evaluated incorrectly for optimized designs.
     * After an Iteration Limit was reached due to a zero-delay oscillation,
       simulation stopped with an error.
     * While parsing external constraint for a class that is extended from a
       parameterized class, vlog used to give the wrong error message "Invalid
       scope specified for constraint block". This error is now fixed.
     * In some cases events triggered by changes to a SystemVerilog class
       property failed to execute the waiting code.
     * Event controls and wait statements on automatic variables inside a fork
       block would sometimes fail to activate the waiting code.
     * Connecting  a SystemVerilog port of type real with a SystemVerilog
       variable of type int would pass incorrect (junk) values. This has been
       fixed.
     * vopt would error out with an incorrect "Failed to find <design-unit> in
       hierarchical name" error when the SystemVerilog bind construct was used
       to bind to a module instantiated inside black boxed regions. This has
       been fixed.
     * vsim would produce an incorrect "Unresolved reference to .*" error when
       binding  to  an  instance  inside  a  black-boxed region using the
       SystemVerilog bind construct. This has been fixed.
     * Using a SystemVerilog break or continue statement inside a repeat loop
       with  a constant repeat count of 1 caused a fatal error during the
       simulation run.
     * Using  a  virtual  interface  type as a type parameter on a module
       instantiation caused vopt to crash with a segmentation fault.
     * Using array query functions like $left, $right, $high, $low or $bits on
       fixed-sized arrays of dynamically sized objects incorrectly reported an
       error when used in a constant expression.
     * Fixed false error involving ext. refs. to elements of modports through a
       virtual interface.
     * Hierarchical references into signals in a clocking block would sometimes
       cause vopt to crash.
     * A non-blocking assignment to a field select of an array element where
       the  type of the variable is a parameter type and there is also an
       assignment  to  the  array index in the same time step may produce
       incorrect results.
     * In  certain cases vopt would produce a segmentation violation when
       coverage was enabled.
     * Certain kinds of non-blocking assignments where the left hand side of
       the assignment contains a part select, bit select, array index, and/or
       field  select may create a process that causes a crash if the user
       interface queries for a list of active processes between the time when
       the NBA is scheduled and the time the NBA is executed.
     * Certain cases might have produced the wrong results for case statements
       where the number of Case Clauses is less than 2. This has now been
       fixed.
     * Extended VCD did not consider the contribution of specify path drivers.
     * The vopt command sometimes reported the error "Failed to find 'super' in
       hierarchical name." incorrectly for static method calls that should have
       resolved into a super class.
     * Declaring a parameter inside a class body and using that parameter to
       declare a type could cause vsim to crash during elaboration in the
       -novopt  flow.  This crash did not occur for parameterized classes
       declared like: "class C #(...parameter list...)"
     * Always_comb sensitivity was not being computed correctly for external
       references with indexed names.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.5b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * If a named association in a port map is partially associated to OPEN,
       then if the open subelement is a slice or record, elaboration would
       cause a crash.
     * In the non-vopt flow compiled SDF annotator could not resolve instances
       under VHDL generate blocks. Therefore, SDF annotations targeted to such
       instances failed.
     * Running vcom or vopt with Finite State Machine detection enabled (+acc
       or +acc=f) on Windows platforms would sometimes result in an error
       message like:
       # ** Fatal: Unexpected signal: 11.
     * If a process is stopped in a subprogram with signal parameters, the
       simulator could crash while trying to get information on the signal
       parameter to display in the GUI.
     * If SDF is applied to a design containing VHDL, the values of record type
       generics may become corrupt. Additionally, the tool may report the
       error:
       Defparam iteration limit of 10 exceeded.
     * Package standard functions to_bstring, to_binary_string, to_octal_string
       and to_hex_string were visible regardless of what VHDL language version
       was used. This caused potential conflicts with same named subprograms
       declared  in other packages. Now these names are only visible when
       language version VHDL2008 is used.
     * The -check_synthesis option warning message #1400 could sometimes report
       the incorrect file name when vcom was invoked with more than one file
       name on its command line.
     * A suite of -lint messages for vcom has been implemented. These assist in
       pointing out some potential simulation errors.
       Message #1292 occurs when the prefix of a slice name has an unknown
       index range direction (such as, but not limited to, when the prefix is
       of an unconstrained array type) and the discrete range of the slice has
       a known direction.
       Message  #1298  occurs  when  the  prefix of a slice name is of an
       unconstrained array type and the discrete range of the slice is locally
       static.
       Message  #1293  occurs when the prefix of an indexed name is of an
       unconstrained array type and an index value is locally static.
     * In some cases when a constant vector is driving an input port whose
       dimensions are defined using a generic, vsim may fail giving an invalid
       operand kind error. This is now fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.5b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.5b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * The -sc_arg vsim command line option takes the argument that follows it
       on the command line and makes it available for access within the user's
       SystemC code. Some vsim command line options, notably -f, -h, and -l,
       could  not  be  passed with the -sc_arg option. Instead, they were
       interpreted as options to vsim and were not accessible from SystemC.
       This has been fixed.
     * Logging SystemC structures containing float types could sometimes cause
       a crash on the Solaris platform.
     * Fixed scparse-gcc error for ambiguous "+=".
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * Implemented some performance improvements in the assertion browser GUI
       for designs with a large number of assertion instances. This was done
       mainly for the browser's flat mode, not the hierarchical mode.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * If a Verilog or SystemVerilog module that instantiates a VHDL design
       unit is place through use of the SystemVerilog bind statement, the
       design would fail to elaborate and crash.
     * A Verilog parameter of vector type would sometimes produce an incorrect
       error message in vopt saying "generic type mismatch" when connected to a
       VHDL  generic  of integer type. This was only for cases where VHDL
       instantiates Verilog and has been fixed now.
     * VHDL resolved subtypes of record were not correctly handled in scgenmod
       and gen_xml utility. This has been fixed.
     * SignalSpy would give an incorrect type mismatch error with single width
       VHDL vectors (e.g. 4 to 4) as source and single width Verilog vectors
       (like [0:0]) as destination. This has been fixed.
     * scgenmod would generate an incorrect error saying 'unsupported type' for
       VHDL 'unsigned' datatypes. This has been fixed.
     * Wrong     values     were     propagated    while    using    init
       signal_driver/init_signal_spy when the source object was a bit-select of
       a packed Verilog vector. This has been fixed.
     * When incremental flow was used and there were multiple ports in the
       bound Verilog module with the same case-insensitive name (e.g. hdl_sig
       and HDL_Sig), port binding would be incorrect when binding to a VHDL
       target scope using the SystemVerilog bind construct. If the type of
       these ports were different then an incorrect error message would be
       received for a type-mismatch. But when these ports were of the same
       type, wrong port-connections would sometimes be made silently. This has
       been fixed and now the port connections are always correct for such
       cases.
     * Binding a Verilog module/program instance to a specific instance of a
       VHDL target using the SystemVerilog bind construct would not work when
       the bind_target_instance identifier resolves to both an instance name
       and a module name. An example of such usage is:
       bind sub:sub_inst assertmod inst1();
     * vsim  would propagate incorrect values when the SystemVerilog bind
       construct  was used for binding Verilog with VHDL and VHDL integer
       generics were overridden with real values. This has been fixed and now
       an error message will be issued for such cases.
     * When the SystemVerilog bind construct is used to bind Verilog to VHDL
       target scopes, vsim would sometimes report an incorrect "incompatible
       mode" error for inout ports when invoked with the -novopt. This has been
       fixed.
     * The wildcard pattern ".*" used with port connections did not work at the
       SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed language boundary when mixed with other named
       connections. This has been fixed.
     * For SystemVerilog instantiating VHDL, generics of type string would
       acquire incorrect values when overridden with SystemVerilog parameters
       of type string. This has been fixed.
     * scgenmod would exit with a segmentation fault when invoked with the -s
       command-line option on a VHDL entity containing a port of type 'time'.
       This has been fixed.
     * Connecting an input port in the bound SystemVerilog module with an
       output port of the target VHDL would not work while binding to VHDL
       target scopes using the SystemVerilog bind construct when port actual
       expressions contained hierarchical references. This has been fixed.
     * A Verilog port of packed vector type (of bit, reg or logic) having
       negative bound(s) would produce an incorrect error message in vopt when
       connected to a VHDL port of equivalent type. This was only for cases
       where VHDL instantiates Verilog and has been fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * Fixed a Tcl stacktrace error when a design is loaded in the simulation
       GUI in coverage mode which is not compiled with code coverage options.
     * Fixed a merge warning message for weight mismatch in merging regular
       instances with installed instances.
     * vcover merged did not allow installed paths without the leading path
       separator.
     * Test tracker showed that the testplan section was linked when it was
       not. This has been fixed.
     * Source code is annotated to HTML reports even if the -nosource argument
       is passed to the coverage/vcover report command. This has been fixed.
     * Toggle coverage for packed fixed-size arrays was not reported correctly.
       This has been fixed.
     * Coverage pragma 'toggle_ignore' would not exclude variables inside
       SystemVerilog interfaces. This has been fixed.
     * vlog/vcom would silently ignore incorrect usage of coverage pragmas.
       This has been fixed and a warning message will now be issued whenever a
       coverage pragma is used outside design unit scope.
     * When   focused   expression   coverage   finds  more  rows  in  an
       expression/condition than the maximum limit, the warning issued would
       report incorrect number of rows that the expression needs. This has been
       fixed.
     * Command line options -nocovershort and -covershort were incorrectly
       being handled by vsim. These options are only applicable for vlog, vcom
       and vopt. This has been fixed.
     * Toggle  counts  in the Object window would ignore 'countlimit' and
       continue to increment beyond this limit. This has been fixed.
     * The  UDP  truth  table for expressions containing "nand" and "nor"
       operators was incorrect. This has been fixed.
     * When compiled with -coverExcludeDefault, statements inside the default
       block were not excluded. This has been fixed.
     * Some additional constructs have been supported to make toggle coverage
       pragmas more flexible and user friendly. Here are the three constructs
       that are supported:
       /* Using all without the double quotes. */
       //coverage toggle_ignore sig_arr all
       /* Specifying list without double quotes. */
       //coverage toggle_ignore sig_arr 1 4-5
       /* Omitting the word all to implicitly imply excluding all bits. */
       //coverage toggle_ignore sig_arr
     * Excluding individual SystemVerilog and VHDL enum elements using the
       toggle add -exclude command was broken. This has been fixed.
     * Verilog expressions containing single-bit vectors (like 'opcode[0:0] |
       opcode[7:7]') as operands would sometimes evaluate to incorrect values
       when the values of these operands were 'z'. This would only happen when
       code coverage was enabled, and has been fixed.
     * Multi-dimensional  fixed-size packed Verilog arrays were not being
       considered for toggle coverage. This has been fixed.
     * Toggle  coverage reports would incorrectly show single dimensional
       unpacked wire arrays as single toggle nodes. This has been fixed.
     * Multi-dimensional  array  elements  would  incorrectly  appear  as
       single-dimensional array elements in the FEC reports. This has been
       fixed.
     * Toggle  coverage  would  not  count  0->X->1  and 1->X->0 as valid
       transitions. This has been fixed.
     * SystemVerilog unpacked structures were not being automatically included
       for toggle coverage when the design was compiled using +cover=t and vsim
       was invoked with -coverage command-line option. This has been fixed.
     * Toggle  coverage reports would show the number of counts of a real
       variable under the 'Toggled' column instead of the 'Count' column. This
       has been fixed.
     * Statement coverage reports would incorrectly show statements containing
       class headers and endclass as excluded by pragma, even when there was no
       active coverage pragma in the file. This has been fixed.
     * The  Source window showed the exclusion icon on the "case" line in
       viewcov  mode. It's now the same as live simulation mode where the
       exclusion icons are shown only on the case item lines.
     * The number of active case items in the Missed Branch window did not
       reflect the fact that some case items of a case branch are excluded.
     * The expression and condition report summary lines in the Details window
       were not consistent for UDP and FEC rows when all rows are excluded.
     * The Total Coverage and Assertions columns were empty in the Structure
       window when coverage in under VHDL architecture.
     * The excluded coverage items are now marked as "E-hit" in details text
       report when items are hit (having nonzero count). This is the default
       behavior now. The option -noexcludedhits is added in coverage text
       report to disable the showing of excluded hits.

   General Defects Repaired in 6.5b
     * It was possible to specify a target file for vencrypt that would match a
       source file which caused the source file to be overwritten. A read only
       source file would cause a crash.
     * For some designs, vsim could not load a vopt design which referenced
       -archive libraries.
     * sdfcomp errors when the working library is undefined or unwritable
       because the sdfcomp output file can not be created.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.5b
     * On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set
       via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop
       at the breakpoint.
     * On  Windows  platform,  if  breakpoint  is set on a SystemC object
       destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This
       crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which
       will prevent unloading of the shared library.
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
       on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an add
       wave command, when the working directory was created under an older
       32-bit Linux OS.
       This  is  a  Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
       simulator.
       A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator with
       command line option -wlfnolock.
     * The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable. The unwinder is
       the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program
       execution is at. The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance
       data. This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance
       data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.
     * Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and
       memory  profiling at the same time. Memory profiling requires much
       overhead  process,  and it can skew the results of the performance
       profiling data.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on
       consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.
     * On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs
       during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal,
       and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting
       with proper error status.
     * If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of
       warning:
       # Loading mypackage(body)
       #  Internal  Warning  in process_sub: failed to find local inlined
       subprogram called in pkg
       # (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2
       # Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram
       Then add the -noFunctionInline option to vcom for that package, or
       reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they
       are used.
     * Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules,
       interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
       module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
       code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
       instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.
     * The vpiPorts iteration on vpiEnumNet, vpiIntegerNet, and vpiStructNet
       VPI objects has been disabled as it was incomplete and unsafe to use.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.5b
     * The breakpoint behavior of the -cond option has changed to re-parse
       expressions each time the breakpoint is hit. This allows expressions
       with  local  references to work. Note that because of this change,
       condition expressions referencing items outside the context of the
       breakpoint must use absolute names. This is different from the previous
       behavior where a relative signal name would be resolved at the time the
       bp command was issued, allowing the breakpoint to work even though the
       relative signal name was inappropriate when the breakpoint is hit.
     * Errors involving assignments to enums in vlog, vopt, or vsim are now
       printed using message #8386, which is suppressible.
     * In previous versions of the simulator, a random seed was sometimes
       assigned to processes created for non-blocking-assignments, and this
       could affect random-stability, depending on optimizations that were in
       effect.  In  6.5, this is no longer the case; but it may result in
       different results involving randomization from 6.4x.
     * FSM  recognition  reporting in the coverage FSM flow has been made
       consistent with the FSMDEBUG flow. Both flows will only dump the number
       of FSMs detected by default. The -fsmverbose option can be used to
       display FSM RECOGNITION INFO, if required.
     * The default keyboard shortcuts for the cut/copy/paste operations have
       been  changed  to  match  the  Windows  standard  of Control-X/C/V
       respectively. A new preference setting (Main/PCEditBindingsOnUnix)
       category has been added to control this. Note, any opened text windows
       at the time the preference is changed will not see the change until the
       next time the GUI is started.
     * A new search capability has been added for all windows that previously
       supported use of the Contains toolbar and/or the "Edit > Find..." menu.
       This new "Search Bar" will appear along the bottom edge of the window
       it's being used from. It completely replaces the old Contains toolbar
       and individual Find dialog boxes. For those windows that support both
       filtering and finding, the mode for the Search Bar would need to be set
       accordingly (the last selected mode for the Search Bar is remembered
       between sessions). The various ways of choosing the mode are:
          + use Control+M while the Search Bar has the keyboard focus
          + select the mode from the Search Bar's menu (located on icon at far
            left)
          + click the label text which indicates the current mode
       The current mode of the Search Bar is displayed as a text label to the
       left of the type-in field, as well as by the icon located at the left
       edge of the type-in area. The main benefit of having the filtering
       functionality within the Search Bars is that each window now has its own
       unique type-in field as opposed to having to share the common Contains
       toolbar. The latter could lead to confusion over what is shown in the
       toolbar and the filtered content of the windows. There is also a simple
       history mechanism to allow saving search strings for later use. The
       keyboard shortcuts to support this are:
          + Control+S -- save current search text into history list
          + Control+P -- retrieve previous search text
          + Control+N -- retrieve next search text
     * You must now change the encoding of your character representations with
       the encoding system command, where the syntax is:
              encoding system <encoding_name>
       To obtain a complete list of <encoding_name> options, use the encoding
       names command with no arguments. Previously you could perform this
       action with the View > Encoding menu, which has been removed.
     * The VPI compatibility for this release defaults to the 2009 IEEE 1800
       standard. This introduces, among other things, new VPI types for packed
       arrays of struct nets and struct variables. Normative files vpi_user.h,
       sv_vpi_user.h and vpi_compatibility.h are supplied with the latest known
       standardized contents. Users should however be aware that at the time of
       release the IEEE 1800-2009 was not complete.
     * Event order differences between an optimized and unoptimized design have
       been reduced with this release. Specifically, event propagation through
       Verilog zero-delay continuous assignment and primitive networks has been
       changed such that optimizations involving these networks are much less
       likely to result in behavioral differences. However, note that a design
       depending on the old event ordering may not behave the same with this
       release. Both, the unoptimized and optimized behavior may change, but
       should match each other more closely. Ideally, "races" should be removed
       from the design, but, if desired, the user may revert back to the old
       event ordering by specifying the -noimmedca vsim option or by setting
       the following line in the modelsim.ini file:
       ImmediateContinuousAssign = 0
     * Code coverage information is no longer saved under design units in UCDB
       files. Instead, code coverage data for design units are constructed
       on-the-fly when a UCDB file is opened in IN_MEMORY mode. The information
       is constructed by merging all code coverage data from instances in the
       UCDB into the corresponding design unit. This has two main implications
       for UCDB API users:
         1. Using APIs to create code coverage data under design units is not
            allowed anymore and the API calls will error out.
         2. Opening  UCDB  files in read-streaming mode will not generate
            callbacks under design units since there is no code coverage data
            anymore.
     * The PrefMain(ShowFilePane) preference is now obsolete. The Files pane
       will follow current layout as do all other windows.
     * The view * command is now obsolete. The argument "*" will be ignored
       with no note warning or error. A window name or window name prefix must
       be supplied in order to open or configure any windows.
     * When a non-existent entry of an associative array is read, a default
       value is returned. We now re-initialize that value each time, in case
       the user modified it. The exception is if the user set an explicit
       default value.
       For example:
       integer bar[integer][$]; // Assoc. array of queues.
       task execute();
       // Below, bar[2] doesn't exist, so we return the default value,
       // an empty queue. The user is pushing 777 onto it.
       bar[2].push_back(777);
       // Referencing bar[2] again now returns an empty queue. In previous
       // versions, we returned {777}. The $display now prints 'x'.
       $display ("bar [2][0] = %0d", bar[2][0]);
     * Some  changes  have  been  made  to  toggle coverage specific vsim
       command-line options.
          + The  -togglevlogints option has been removed as SystemVerilog
            integer types are now supported for toggle coverage by default.
          + The following vsim command-line options have been changed as they
            were inconsistent with our convention.
               o -togglenoints CHANGED TO -notoggleints
               o -togglenovlogints CHANGED TO -notogglevlogints
     * We now treat a slice of a string as a string. This seems obvious, but it
       is not described anywhere in the LRM. The following is now supported:
              string line = "Hello there";
              string targ;
              initial targ = line[0:5];
     * The option -fsmdebug has been deprecated. A new letter code 'f' has been
       added to +acc to enable FSM detection and debugging. This also makes it
       possible to have module and instance bases selection with FSM debug.
       +acc without any letter code with automatically enable +acc=f.
     * Conditional timing check expressions are displayed as they appear in the
       HDL description. In the past equivalent conditions were displayed. For
       example:
       &&& (cond === 0)
       was displayed as
       &&& (~cond)
     * In some cases the -vmake flag will be required to correctly capture
       Verilog source file dependencies.
     * Invalid vsim command line switches used with -load_elab will now by
       default generate a warning message and not an error message. The warning
       message has a Message Id associated with it and is thus suppressible.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.5b
     * Verilog port direction is not enforced by the language or tools. For
       this reason VCD dumpports uses the location of the drivers on the net to
       determine whether the value being dumped is input or output. A new
       option, -force_direction, has been added to force dumpports to use the
       specified port direction and not driver location to determine direction.
     * In constraints, array reduction methods with the "with" clause were not
       supported (e.g. arr.sum() with (int'(item)) == 12;). Now, this support
       has been added.
     * The command force, without any options, produces a list of existing
       forces. The forces listed were only forces that occurred due to prior
       force commands. This listing behavior has been enhanced to also list
       forces coming from the Signal Spy signal_force()/$signal_force() calls
       from within VHDL/Verilog source code.
     * The extraction parameter "searchpath" is added to the xml2ucdb utility
       (command-line option -searchpath) to specify one or more directories to
       be searched by xml2ucdb looking for test plans' XML files. The option
       allows directory searching for nested test plans defined in the XML to
       be set on the command line and within the ini file. This then allows the
       testplan to be just a filename.
     * The vlog command now has a new switch -novtblfixup that affects the
       behavior of virtual method calls in SystemVerilog class constructors. By
       default, while a constructor is executing the this reference is treated
       as  if it is a handle to the type of the active new() method which
       implies that virtual method calls resolve will not execute methods of an
       uninitialized class type. With -novtblfixup the type of this does not
       change during construction, and virtual method calls behave as they
       would in normal class methods.
     * vdir  -l will now display the start location of a design unit. The
       location is displayed in the form <filename>:<line number>.
     * A new option -modelsimini /path/to/modelsim.ini has been added to vsim,
       vcom, vlog, vopt, sccom, scgenmod, vgencomp, vmap, vdir, vdel, vmake,
       vcover, sm_entity and hm_entity. The default ini settings would be set
       using the file specified with the option.
