This Modelsim package was tested on vanilla Ubuntu 20 LTS.

If using a 64-bit Ubuntu environment, make sure 32-bit executable files can be run.
In order to do this, open a terminal and execute the following commands:
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libx11-6:i386 libxtst6:i386

To start the Modelsim environment, run in a terminal the following commands:
  cd <path_to_the_extracted_modelsim_folder>/ #replace the directory placeholder with your correct path
  ./bin/vsim
