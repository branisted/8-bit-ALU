<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2j</b>
<ul>
<li>
In vopt, when analyzing a parent module containing multiple instances of a child containing a large number of similar instantiations, vopt could fail with an internal error.</li>
<li>
The usage of ".*" for implicit port connection causes too much memory to be consumed especially in Verilog designs with large netlists.</li>
<li>
In cases where named event variables are returned from an automatic task or 
function vsim would sometimes generate spurious event triggers.
</li>
<li>
vopt did not correctly handle designs with the same System Verilog package name contained within multiple libraries. This caused an error message indicating that vopt failed to open a data file.
</li>
<li>
Optimization with vopt could produce incorrect vector results when optimizing through continuous assignments containing concatenations of net part selects where the selected nets were themselves driven by continuous assignments of concatenations.</li>
<li>
The $nochange task reported simultaneous data and clock events as violations.  This contradicted the IEEE 1364-2001 specification. 
</li>
<li>
The array 'shuffle' method now uses the <b>-sv_seed</b> value for seeding its random number generator.  This means that the results of 'shuffle' are repeatable.</li>
<li>
Accessing a class property that was directly inherited from a non-parameterized class which had a parameterized class inheritance ancestor could cause incorrect memory locations to be accessed.  A prototypical case would be:
<pre>
    class base #(int p = 1);
    endclass
    class mid extends base#();
       int x,y;
    endclass
    class derived extends mid;
    endclass

    derived d = new;  // accessing x or y via d could cause problems.
</pre></li>
<li>
Ref ports could not be logged if the object the port referenced was already logged.  This was also the case for non-ref register ports if the actual and formal were of the same type and length.</li>
<li>
Optimized Verilog cell functions incorrectly write input of net type supply1 and supply0.</li>
<li>
For static elements of a class, sometimes accessing a built-in function resulted in this internal error: <br>
<code>
Error: test.sv(25): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vallocate.c(1349) self
</code></li>
<li>
A process, edge sensitive to a vector, could fail to execute when a different process is sensitive to a single bit of the vector.</li>
<li>
System Verilog designs using fork..join_none blocks that reference automatic variables declared outside the block could cause memory failures and segmentation faults.</li>
<li>
Bit-Select expressions used with assignment operators such as +=, -=, |=, etc. sometimes caused errors like:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(9843) !is_cancelledOf(e)
</code></li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in some cases if a non-blocking assignment update triggered a <b>when</b> command, which in turn executed a <b>stop</b> command.</li>
<li>
If a SDF file referenced an instance name and a portname (in that order) that are identical, sdfcom crashed.
</li>
<li>
System Verilog data type string is defined as a built-in typedef.  This caused vlog to crash in a DPI related function.
</li>
<li>
When using a module based bind in a Verilog design with a top-level configuration in effect, incorrect errors of the form "<i>name</i> already declared in the bind target scope." could be reported.</li>
<li>
Annotating SDF to System Verilog designs, with <b>-v2k_int_delays switch</b>, caused a crash if the modules with variable data type ports were present.
</li>
<li>
Verilog conditional compilation now correctly ignores the text "`if/`else/`endif" when such text is embedded within a string literal.
</li>
</ul>

Under certain conditions, applying compiled SDF to a design caused signal propagation failures across VHDL-System Verilog hierarchical boundaries.
</li>
<li>
Instantiation of a Verilog configuration from a VHDL design unit would sometimes fail to process the configuration's cell and instance statements.</li>

<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.2j</b>
<ul>
<li>
vcover was hanging while trying to read a UCDB file.</li>
<li>
An internal error occurred during expression coverage.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with VHDL condition and expression coverage related to the
handling of VHDL 'H' and 'L' values. Previously, conditions and expressions
automatically converted 'H' and 'L' input values to '1' and '0', respectively. 
This simplified the UDP tables, but could result in incorrect behavior for
circuits that used and tested for 'H' and 'L'. Now,
to NOT convert input values as described, set the new modelsim.ini variable "CoverRespectHandL" to 1, or use the option <b>vcom -coverrespecthandl</b>.<p>
Using this option may make the UDP tables more complicated. To simplify them
for logic that cannot assume 'H' and 'L' values, change your VHDL expressions of the form (a = '1') to (to_x01(a) = '1') or to std_match(a,'1'). These functions will be recognized and used to simplify the UDP tables.</li>

dts0100420251 - After disabling many signals, logging could crash with floating point or memory problems.</li>
<li>
dts0100423776 - Fixed a System Verilog covergroup cross support bug where a warning on maximum RHS cross products is incorrectly issued. The bogus warning is similar to "Warning: The number of Cross products for user bin 'igbin' of Cross 'cross_a_b' exceeded the limit 'max_rhs_cross_products = 1000'. Modify the 'max_rhs_cross_products' variable in modelsim.ini to change the limit."</li>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.2j</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.</li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.2j</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GBytes.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default <size> unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either <b>Kb</b>, <b>Mb</b> or <b>Gb</b> specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code> vcd limit 6Gb </code><br>
or <br>
<code> vcd limit 400Mb </code></li>
<li>
The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro body through the macro substitution process.
</li>
