<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The data in the Verification Management Browser pane was corrupt after loading the UCDB file which contained User Attributes.</li>
<li>
The top node of the tracker pane of the Verification Management window contained incorrect information when filtered with testname(s).</li>
<li>
Class inheritance relationships could be incorrectly recorded in the GUI causing infinite loops when using "typespec -ancestry" or similar queries to inspect the inheritance structure.</li>
<li>
Inserting Wave window dividers caused a crash in some cases if it's name contained non-alpha-numeric characters such as '#', ';', etc.</li>
<li>
In vopt mode, vsim failed to find the top level design when the design name is an
escaped or extended identifier, and if the name is specified using the other escaped or extended identifier rule in the command line.
</li>
<li>
Unable to <b>add list</b> or <b>add wave</b> an object when the path contained an array instance.</li>
<li>
Fixed a memory leak with "coverage analyze" that could have caused memory to run out on large queries on large designs; also fixed a freed memory write associated with the merge of (optionally enabled) covergroup sample count enhancements.
</li>
<li>
An event at time 0 on a Verilog named event did not displayed in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
The Wave window did not draw some System Verilog registers in the correct color if all bits were 'z' (blue) or all bits were 'x' (red).</li>
<li>
A crash occurred in certain cases when the Source window tried to display signal values by either source annotation or hovering over signals with the mouse. This occurred when the source had dependencies on either `included files or objects declared in the global (vunit) scope.</li>
<li>
Source Annotation and Textual Dataflow features did not work in post-sim mode.  </li>
<li>
Embedded space in TR relation names was not handled properly in the GUI.  This has been corrected for relationships only and works with both the SCV API and the Verilog API.  The simulator will still generate a warning if it sees whitespace in stream names, attribute names or transaction names.</li>
<li>
Virtual signal concatenations resulting in a record type no longer display field names as redundant name such as .fieldname=fieldname.</li>
<li>
Wave dividers imbedded in a wave group were not correctly restored from a wave format file (wave.do) or following a restart.</li>
<li>
Wave window printing was missing all text.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The wrong file name was reported for some error messages about default values in formal task/function arguments lists.</li>
<li>
Partially optimized designs (i.e. "black-boxes") did not properly pass parameter
information between the instantiation point of the black-box and the black-box
itself.  Parameters are now passed, and are checked for consistency as well.
</li>
<li>
Procedural blocking assignment statements with complex expressions and an intra-assignment timing control sometimes assigned a value from the wrong design instance.</li>
<li>
Re-declaration of 1-dimensional unpacked array port incorrectly reported error.</li>
<li>

When bit stream casting involved an array of array of struct, vsim gave incorrect output.</li>
<li>
In cases involving elaboration time types (such as type parameters or references to interface elements), array system functions such as $left incorrectly generated the following error at compile time:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illegal array identifier in array querying function.
</code></li>
<li>
When using brackets across a time literal ( e.g. #(1s) ), simulation was incorrectly progressing by 0 time units.</li>
<li>
Using a "bind" statement in a generate loop where the bind target was an instance with an index in the hierarchical path failed.  This is now supported for index expressions that are literals or, in the vopt flow, expressions involving other constants such as genvars or parameters.</li>
<li>
When a part-select into a memory element was out-of-bounds, the simulator returned 0's instead of X's for the out-of-range spots.</li>
<li>
Always_comb sensitivity to a slice of an element of a packed struct was not being correctly set.</li>
<li>
A vopt crash occurred when setuphold/recrem timing checks have argument conditions and event conditions.</li>
<li>
Path name specifiers in libmap files can now be optionally quoted. Even though the standard does not specify quotation marks, this is a common practice.</li>
<li>
Wildcard meta characters '*', '?', and "..." within pathname specifiers in libmap files are now supported.</li>
<li>
If a VHDL (or other non-Verilog design unit) instantiated more than one child instance that made use of complex parameterized class relationships, memory assertions could incorrectly result during elaboration.</li>
<li>
Using named event declarations in multiple child instances where only some of the children were inlined could result in elaboration or simulation memory corruption and subsequent failures.</li>
<li>
Starting in release 6.2h, VHDL design units that reference Verilog design units began to report an out-of-date error when inconsequential changes were made to the Verilog module.  The previous behavior has been restored so this error should only occur if changes in the Verilog model could have some impact on the VHDL code.</li>
<li>
vlog and vopt generated internal errors if a parameter override in a bind instance was a type expression (e.g. "logic").</li>
<li>
Fatal elaboration error vsim-3614 could incorrectly occur in designs when vopt was used and inlining occurred for modules containing certain forms of generate loops.</li>
<li>
Invalid vsim-3700 elaboration errors could occur when accessing an array member of a struct by way of a virtual interface.</li>
<li>
vsim invoked with the options <b>-novopt -v2k_int_delays</b> caused vsim to hang in certain cases.
</li>
<li>
The use of ".*" with instance-arrays had several problems.</li>
<li>
A blocking assignment having an intra-assignment timing control was optimized away in some cases, resulting in the incorrect side effect of losing the delay in the block of sequential statements.</li>
<li>
The sensitivity extracted for always_comb failed to account for variables read within code determined to be unreachable (by optimizations) within a called function.</li>
<li>
Always_comb sensitivity was not being set correctly when a referenced variable was indexed by a genvar. For example:<br>
<code>
genvar GVAR;
<br>generate
<br>for (GVAR=0; GVAR <= 1; GVAR++) begin : genblk
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   always_comb o_always[GVAR] = gate & (a_var[GVAR][0]|b_var[GVAR]);
<br>end
<br>endgenerate
</code></li>
<li>
There were two problems with annotating DEVICE statements with compiled SDF.
</li>
<li>
Aggregate Literals were not being allowed when used in comparison operations. For example (s == '{1,1}) where "s" is a structure variable.</li>
<li>
A constraint specifying an equality constraint (==,!=) between cyclic random variables in certain cases caused a fatal internal error within the constraint solver.</li>
<li>
Errors were not being reported for illegal method overrides involving 
static and virtual conflicts and invalid changes of lifetime.</li>
<li>
In scenarios typically involving calls from parameterized classes, checking was not being performed for illegal task and function enables with, for example, too many parameters or too few parameters.  Such illegal calls would then cause fatal
errors during simulation.  Elaboration time errors are now generated for such
cases.
</li>
<li>
When a string comparison or other operation combined a string literal and a reference to a System Verilog string member inherited from a parameterized class or type parameter, a simulation time fatal error could result.</li>
<li>
In some cases involving complex System Verilog class relationships, vlog and vopt design analysis became very slow.
</li>
<li>
A hierarchical reference to an UDP port caused vopt to crash.</li>
<li>
When analyzing a System Verilog compilation unit containing declarations in $unit and at least one package, certain errors would be reported more than once, with earlier errors having misleading or missing file names.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
A crash occurred if a value-change callback completed on an object for which the VPI handle had previously been freed.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with the indexing of objects obtained via vpi_handle_by_name for multiple packed dimension regs.</li>
<li>
The return value of vpi_get_value() when accessing an array element with an invalid index has been reverted to the pre-6.3 behavior. The pointer elements of the value union before 6.3, and in 6.3a, are NULL when any index is invalid. In 6.3, the value returned pointed to the default value for the element. The LRM is unclear on what is expected; users are recommended not to rely on either behavior, and to determine index validity via other methods.</li>
<li>
VPI was not correctly processing arrays of packed structures where the arrays had both packed and unpacked dimensions. The symptoms included both bad values returned, and crashes when attempting to get value for sub-elements of these constructs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a shared library or dll could not be loaded during elaboration, previous releases generated an error message but not abort the design elaboration.
In 6.3a, the default behavior is to still not abort the design elaboration but
it issues a warning instead of an error. If the user desires to abort elaboration
they can raise the warning to an error by adding <b>-error 3160</b> to the vsim command line.</li>
<li>
When a package was compiled with the default optimization level (absent <b>-On </b>option), and a design unit that depends on the package was compiled with <b>-O0</b> or with coverage (which forces <b>-O0</b>), bad code for the design unit resulted in a simulator crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
A process with an if_statement whose condition contains a selected signal name expression in certain cases caused a crash during elaboration. The name reported of the failing process would contain #MERGED#.</li>
<li>
The following invalid slice error: <br>
<code> ** Fatal: (vsim-3607) Slice range direction (to) does not match slice prefix direction (downto).<br>
#    Time: 0 ns  Iteration: 0  Instance: /testcase File: testcase.vhdl Line: 29<br>
</code>
Occurred in certain cases if a formal of a port map is associated by subelement to a sequence of actual expressions that index the same object as shown in the following code: <br>
<code>
PORT MAP ( F(0)=>A(0), F(1)=>A(1), F(2)=>A(3) )<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
On rare occasions, a clock-suppressed optimized process failed to evaluate producing incorrect simulation results.</li>
<li>
A warning message (number 135) is issued when a based-literal (binary, octal or hex) cannot represent a positive number but can represent a negative value. This message can be suppressed to duplicate previous behavior, or it can be elevated to error status to more closely follow the strict semantics of the VHDL LRM.</li>
<li>
An expanded name (either in a USE clause or as the subytpe indication of an object declaration), where the prefix is a package name and the suffix is the type mark of a composite type having an element of a composite type, would not facilitate use of that element type for the purpose of determining the type of string literals and aggregates.  For example, the assignment to an element of the myarray type variable in the following would not compile because the element type (elem) was erroneously not made available for said purpose.  This has been fixed so that the following will compile correctly.
<pre>
   package pkg is
      type elem is array(1 to 2) of integer;
      type myarray is array(1 to 2) of elem;
   end package;
   entity e is end;
   architecture a of e is
   begin
      process is
         variable var : work.pkg.myarray;
      begin
         var(2) := (2=>45,1=>76);
         wait;
      end process;
   end architecture;
</pre></li>
<li>
In certain cases the simulator failed with the message: <br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3964) grab_scalar: unexpected size.<br>
#    Time: 0 ps  Iteration: 0  Process: /testbench/DUT/abc/wiredelay/line__1104
File: /u/somefile.vhd <br>
</code>

The problem was caused by using the `last_value attribute on a vector signal.

</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Signal Spy failed to handle a 1-bit wide Verilog vector as the src_object, resulting in incorrect updates of the dest_object and possibly acc_set_value() errors.</li>
<li>
Instantiation of a VHDL design unit from Verilog in an optimized design resulted in a crash during elaboration in some cases if the VHDL design unit name is an extended identifier beginning with "\.".</li>
<li>
Mixed language instantiations of partially optimized designs did not work in all cases (e.g. Verilog, instantiating a black-box with a VHDL root).</li>
<li>
An attempt to capture extended VCD for a VHDL design unit having an inout port connected to a hierarchically referenced Verilog net resulted in a vsim-VCD-3202 error if the hierarchical reference was to a net not in the parent hierarchy of the instantiation.</li>
<li>
When the stop or finish procedures are called from VHDL in a mixed VHDL/Verilog design under some circumstances spurious characters were printed.</li>
<li>
All files within libraries were created with permissions 666 (read/write access for user/group/other), ignoring the current umask setting.</li>
<li>
vopt generated an error if the target of bind is VHDL and the port map of bind has the .named style of port mapping.</li>
<li>
vsim or vopt generated internal errors in certain cases where the target of System Verilog bind is VHDL, the actual of bind has a non-variable expressions and the port mapping is by named association.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
When vsim refreshed a file at load time, the modelsim.ini file variable "CoverOpt"
did not get properly applied.</li>
<li>
When vopt inlined a Verilog module, and that module had more than one instance, the coverage numbers became corrupt for those instances. </li>
<li>
Made coverage options more symmetrical by adding vcom <b>-nocoverNosub</b> and
vcom/vlog/vopt <b>-nocoverExcludeDefault</b>. </li>
<li>
There was a vlog compile bug for expression coverage if a ternary expression
contains an exclusive-OR operator in one of the operands.</li>
<li>
There was a issue in vopt with coverage on, in the mode in which coverage is
automatically turned off for <b>-v</b> or <b>-y</b> included modules. Coverage could also accidentally get turned off for other modules that should have coverage on.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage clear</b> command has been implemented for viewcov mode.  The command arguments are the same as in vsim mode.</li>
<li>
The first input file is ignored in vcover merge if the <b>-out</b> option is specified after the input files in command line.</li>
<li>
Added a limit to the count for a toggle node. This will increase simulation
performance with toggle coverage on and still give you information about what nodes did not toggle at all. After the limit is reached,
further activity on the node will be ignored for toggle coverage. All possible
transition edges must reach this count for the limit to take effect. For
example, if you are collecting toggle data on 0->1 and 1->0 transitions, both
transition counts must reach the limit. If you are collecting "full" data on
6 edge transitions, all 6 must reach the limit. The count limit is controlled 
by the modelsim.ini variable <b>ToggleCountLimit</b> ,
which defaults to 1. A value of 0 will
be treated as "unlimited". If you want different
limits on different design units, vcom and vlog have a 
<b>-togglecountlimit</b> option. Also, vsim has a 
<b>-togglecountlimit</b> option as well, if you want to override the ini
file variable everywhere, like for a batch run. </li>
<li>
Verilog integer types are no longer added to toggle coverage by default,
except for System Verilog enumeration types. They
consume a great deal of time in the simulation, accumulating counts for each
of the 32-bits separately, as for a Verilog reg. If you want toggle
coverage for Verilog integer types, set the modelsim.ini variable
<b>ToggleVlogIntegers</b> to 1, or use vsim <b>-togglevlogints</b>. If the ini
file has it turned on and you want to turn it off in vsim, use 
vsim <b>-togglenovlogints</b>.</li>
<li>
A limit has been placed on the maximum width of signals that are automatically
added to toggle coverage. This is to try to filter out memories from toggle
coverage. The limit applies to Verilog registers and VHDL arrays. If the register or array is larger than the limit, it is not added to toggle coverage automatically with <b>-cover t</b>. The width limit is controlled by the modelsim.ini variable <b>ToggleWidthLimit</b> and defaults to 128. A value of 0 is taken as "unlimited". Also, vcom, vlog and vsim have <b>-togglewidthlimit</b> options to allow you to control it on a design unit basis.</li>
<li>
The <b>-cover sbceft</b> option now checks for illegal characters in the argument
field.</li>
<li>
In order to be consistent with the new toggle count limit and toggle width
limit, the <b>toggle add</b> command has been enhanced to allow 
<b>-countlimit</b> and <b>-widthlimit</b> args to override the global
settings in effect. </li>
<li>
The optimization levels with code coverage on have been increased. The
CoverOpt variable in the modelsim.ini file now defaults to 3. This means
that Verilog continuous assignment optimizations will be included, which
will enable constant propagation to work as expected. Also VHDL subprogram
inlining will be enabled. This should give a measurable performance increase
for most designs.</li>
<li>
2-dimensional VHDL arrays are now filtered out from toggle coverage. This is
to prevent toggle coverage on memories. There is currently no mechanism to
override this.</li>
<li>
There were several defects in XML Import utility (xml2ucdb):
<ul><li>Weight and goal fields now take on default values when field contains only an empty string.</li>
    <li>Core dump on sunos5 platform when section or title fields were left blank.</li>
    <li>Bug with unlabelled data items in GamePlan input files.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
Buffer overflow resulted in strange characters appearing in test record field on top-level summary page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
vopt gave wrong results or crashed in some cases when an entity in the
work library instantiates an entity in a second library, and the second entity
instantiates an entity or module back in the work library.</li>
<li>
In some cases parameters or generics that were specified with override
values via the <b>-G</b> option in vopt or vsim  caused invalid warning messages. For example:<br>
<code>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3351) Invalid value 'test' for generic 'gen1'.  Not using this value.<br>
#    Time: 0 ns  Iteration: 0  Region: /flipflop1/u1  File: ./src/flipflop.vhd<br></code>
</code>
These messages no longer occur.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-G</b>/<b>-g</b> switches to vopt will now always set the generic or paramter specified. It is no longer required to specify the <b>-G</b>/<b>-g</b> switches on both vopt and vsim to get the desired behavior. Designs that currently specify different <b>-G</b>/<b>-g</b> switches on vsim than vopt may now generate warning stating that the vsim <b>-G</b>/<b>-g</b> switches are being ignored.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with transaction streams.  If a stream was created at time C and then used to record a transaction that spanned C, that is from time C-m to time C+n, that transaction would appear to end at time C rather than at time C+n.  There is a side affect of this fix that is visible in the Wave window.  If a stream's first transaction starts AFTER the creation time, the Wave window would show an inactive line from the creation time to the start time. This line is no longer drawn.</li>
<li>
Wave data can be displayed incorrectly when the view is zoomed out if signals do not change values for long periods.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existant on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Attempting to traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an instance or a scope will result in a crash.</li>
<li>
There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.
</ul></li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below the product directory.</li>
<li>
The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see "vcover report -html").</li>
<li>
Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted.  For example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)" and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.  The conditions under which
name permutation could occur are based on internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly correlated to source descriptions.
</li>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
<br>...
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.
</li>
<li>
This release includes the new Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
Turning on code coverage will now turn off fewer simulator optimizations. This
will result in faster simulations with code coverage on. But you will notice
some differences in code coverage data because of various optimizations. For
instance, optimizations that prevent invoking of always blocks unless the 
data changes in addition to the clock, will result in reduced hit counts for
statements within those blocks. In addition, VHDL processes that are recognized
as clocked flip flops may have confusing numbers in the IF branch coverage. 
The level of optimization with code coverage is now controlled by the <b>CoverOpt</b> modelsim.ini variable or an additional character allowed in 
the <b>-cover</b> option to <b>vcom</b>, <b>vlog</b> or <b>vopt</b>. This is
a digit from 1 to 4, with the following meanings (the default is 2):<p>
1 -- Turn off all optimizations that affect coverage reports.<p>
2 -- Allow optimizations that allow large performance improvements
by invoking sequential processes only when the data changes. Allow VHDL FF
recognition. 
This may make major reductions in coverage counts.<p>
3 -- In addition, allow optimizations that may change expressions or
remove some statements. Allow constant propagation. Allow VHDL
subprogram inlining.<p>
4 -- In addition, allow optimizations that may remove major regions of
code by changing assignments to built-ins or removing unused
signals. Change Verilog gates to continuous assignments.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving <b>vopt</b> the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line
  <ol>
  <li>Added a "-verbose" option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A "-ucdbfilename <file>" option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any "-format <format>" option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the confuguration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The "-tagseparators <chars>" option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.3a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Basic command line editing available in command-line mode (vsim -c).  The arrow keys can be used from the shell to recall previous commands (up/down) and to edit the current command (left/right).  See the reference manual for a more detailed description.</li>
<li>
New Wave Window Cursor and Timeline features:
<ul>
<li>User definable time scale: a different time unit can be selected for use in the timeline and cursor time values.  The time value will be scaled appropriately for the selected unit.  This time unit is configured using the Cursor & Timeline configuration dialog.</li>
<li>Frequency deltas: The time delta between two cursors can display frequency instead.  This feature is enabled from the Cursor and Timeline configuration dialog.</li>
<li>Cursor Toolbox: To the left of the cursor row is a set of icons, 3 per row that will give you quick access to Cursor and Timeline features and configurations.</li>
<li>Short/Long signal name display: The Cursor Toolbox includes a button that will easily and conveniently toggle between short and long pathnames in the name column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The <b>-prunechildren</b> and <b>-noprunechildren</b> options to "coverage analyze" allow more intuitive results for some kinds of coverage analysis.  The default is <b>-noprunechildren</b>, which means that the report includes sub-items of coverage items or test plan sections that survive a -select filter; this is useful for cases where users wish to subdivide a test plan report by category or area of responsibility.
</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage attr</b> command can accept a <b>-plan</b> argument to apply to test plan sections.  There is no difference between <b>-plan</b> and <b>-path</b> for setting UCDB attributes with "attr" but use of <b>-plan</b> is more consistent with usage of "coverage analyze", where there is a functional difference between <b>-plan</b> and <b>-path</b>.
</li>
<li>
Support is added for consuming the PLI TAB file with the <b>-tab</b> option.
<br><b>Syntax:</b>
<code>
<br>vopt -tab &lt;tabFile&gt;
<br>vsim -tab &lt;tabFile&gt;
</code>

<br>&lt;tabFile&gt; -- a .tab file used with VCS based on version 7.2 syntax.
<br>
<b>Use flow:</b>
<br>For the two step flow (VSIM implicitly invoking VOPT or the NOVOPT flow), the -tab file is to be specified to vsim only.
<br>For the three step flow (user explicitly running VOPT), the -tab file must be specified to <b>both</b> vopt and vsim.

<br>Refer to User's Manual for a more detailed description.</li>
<li>
Limited class logging and viewing has been added to this release as a beta feature. Many class types can now be logged into the vsim.wlf file for post-simulation viewing using the <b>vsim -view vsim.wlf</b> command. Viewing of class variables in the Wave window during simulation is not yet supported and may lead to problems if they are added to the Wave window during simulation.<br>
Class variables will not be logged as part of a wildcard log command (i.e. <b>add log *</b> will not cause class variables to be logged). So existing scripts will not be affected.  To log class variables, you must log them specifically by name:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  class myClass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  endclass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  myclass myClassVariable = new;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  VSIM> add log *                 #Will not log class variables<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  VSIM> add log myClassVariable<br>
</code>
In addition, you can also log all class objects of a particular class type using the <b>add log -class</b> command with the name of the class. For example:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add log -class myClass
</code>
<br>
This will log all objects of the type myClass or any derived classes of myClass that come into existence following the <b>add log</b> command.<br>

When viewing class variable waveforms post-simulation using <b>vsim -view vsim.wlf</b> you will notice class variable values in the Wave window having values such as "@1", "@2", etc.  These are the simulator's representation of the object handles that the class variable contains. So at time 100, myClassVariable might contain "@1" while at time 200 it will change to "@2".  These object handles can themselves be waved using <b>add wave @1</b> and examined using the command <b>examine @2</b>.
</li>
<li>
New features and changes in XML Import (xml2ucdb):
<ul><li>External entities in the XML source (ie: &...;) are now ignored, character entities (ie: &10;) are converted to the corresponding character.</li>
    <li>Extraction parameters "goaltag" and "weighttag" added to recognize goal/weight as explicitly tagged elements.</li>
    <li>Extraction parameters "linkattr" and "typeattr" added to support link/type as attributes of a single element.</li>
    <li>Extraction parameter "stylesheet" added to support XSL stylesheet-based pre-processing.</li>
    <li>Extraction parameter "sectionprefix" is now supported in autonumber mode.</li>
    <li>Scope path is now squawked for some XML input data errors.</li>
    <li>Section titles containing the current path separator ('/' by default) are now converted to VHDL escaped identifiers before storing.</li>
    <li>Testplan-to-design linking rules were modified significantly:
    <ul><li>Type string "CoverPoint" is now recognized.</li>
        <li>Links of type CoverGroup not containing commas or colons now map to "-cvgmatch link"</li>
        <li>Links of type CoverPoint or Cross not containing commas or colons not map to "-cvpmatch link"</li>
        <li>Generic "CoverItem" type is now recognized (no special covergroup:coverpoint processing, maps to "-path" or "-match").</li>
        <li>Links NOT of type CoverGroup, CoverPoint, or Cross now map to "-match link" even if they contain commas and/or colons.</li>
        <li>Links of type CoverGroup, CoverPoint, or Cross containing commas and/or colons now emit errors if one or more of the sub-strings in the pattern are missing or empty.</li>
        <li>Links of type CoverGroup, CoverPoint, or Cross which start with a path separator ("/") are split into a path portion (mapped to "-path") and a covergroup:coverpoint
            portion which is parsed and mapped as before (see documentation).</li>
        <li>If path field value is set to "-" it will be ignored (useful for path-per-link case where one or more link values don't require a path).</li></ul></li>
    <li>FrameMaker XML files are now supported (format: Frame).</li>
    <li>Extraction parameters for GamePlan XML files were added to the configuration file (format: GamePlan).</li>
</li>
<li>
New functionality added to HTML Report Generator:
<ul><li>Functional coverage results have been added to design scope coverage summary pages.</li>
    <li>Section numbers have been added to testplan scopes in hierarchy tree and to testplan coverage summary pages.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
The following FLI functions have been enhanced to support SystemC variables:
<ul>
<li>mti_FirstVar()
<li>mti_NextVar()
<li>mti_GetArrayVarValue()
<li>mti_GetVarValueIndirect()
<li>mti_GetVarAddr()
<li>mti_GetVarImage()
<li>mti_GetVarImageById()
<li>mti_GetVarName()
<li>mti_GetVarType()
<li>mti_GetVarValue()
</ul>

(note: writing a value via the pointer returned by mti_GetVarAddr() is not supported.)<br>

These FLI functions do not support SystemC variables:
