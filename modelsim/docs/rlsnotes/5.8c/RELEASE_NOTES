   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 5.8
       release.
          + For Linux:
               o Linux  is  built  on  RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1.
                 This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher.
               o RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release
                 with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60.
               o RedHat 9.0 and RedHat Enterprise Workstation 3.0 are now
                 supported (32-bit only).
               o AMD  Opteron  is  now  supported running SuSE SLES 9 (in
                 32-bit  mode  only). It is not recommended to run 32-bit
                 ModelSim on versions of SuSE earlier than 9.
               o Linux now supports large files.
          + For AIX:
               o AIX 5.2 is supported in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
               o rs64  is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1
                 and higher OS versions.
               o rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
               o rs64  will  support  large  files if you are using a JFS
                 type file system and the large file option is enabled.
               o AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8  betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating  your  Libraries"  in  the  ModelSim  Installation &
       Licensing Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.8c  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.8c release from
       5.7x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim 5.8b and
            greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features  in vlog 5.8c: the first is by using the -sv command line
       option  and  the  second is by naming the source file with a ".sv"
       suffix.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * In  waveform  compare, if the flag to ignore Verilog strengths was
       not  set,  the  comparison  did  not use the X-matching table, and
       required an exact match.
     * The  EDITOR  environment  variable  on  Windows  could  not handle
       backslashes.
     * The  child  signals  of PSL assertion directives now appear in the
       Wave  window  as  individual  elements  of  the  parent directive.
       Previously,  these  signals  would  be concatenated into flattened
       arrays.
     * With  toggle  coverage  enabled, the toggle coverage misses window
       would not display a bus correctly when only one bit of the bus was
       left uncovered (missed).
     * A  signal  name was shortened in the Wave Properties dialog box if
       the  name  was  too long. A balloon help popup containing the full
       signal  name will now appear if the user moves the cursor over the
       shortened signal name.
     * Opening  a  dataset  during a run prevented the current simulation
       time from being displayed.
     * Assertion signal names in the Wave window now respond correctly to
       the  WaveSignalNameWidth  variable  setting.  This  can  be set in
       modelsim.ini or via the Wave window's preferences.
     * The [transcript file] command failed when executed from a proc.
     * The  Execution  option from the Project popup menu did not execute
       the  do command in the proper scope causing global variables to be
       invisible.
     * The  i,  o,  l, f, and r hotkeys in the Wave window intermittently
       stopped working.
     * There  was  a Wave window problem where using the Control key with
       the left mouse button to perform Wave window zooming resulted in a
       TCL traceback starting with the following line:
       Trace  back:  can't  read "vsimPriv(.mZ:grid)": no such element in
       array
     * When saving an edited source file when the file pathname contained
       spaces, a Tcl error occurred. This is a Unix only issue.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * vlog erroneously attempted to scan -v libraries during a -refresh.
     * vlog  issued  an  error  for  multiply  defined  modules. This was
       changed to a warning and the last module defined is now used.
     * An  explicitly  typed parameter failed to retain the explicit type
       when  compiled with -fast. The type was taken from the final value
       assigned to the parameter.
     * Extraneous   compile   errors  coming  from  inactive  conditional
       generate branches were removed (-fast mode only).
     * Refreshing an optimized design in some cases left one or more UDPs
       unrefreshed.
     * The  change  command now accepts string data for Verilog registers
       (e.g. change reg1 \"newstringvalue\").
     * Non-blocking  assignments to automatic variables were not reported
       as  errors  when  no  delay or event control was used. This is now
       reported as an error.
     * Named   parameter   assignment   to  VHDL  generics  is  now  case
       insensitive.
     * The  simulator  crashed when a VHDL configuration at the top level
       of a design contained Verilog modules with generate constructs.
     * In  some  cases  use  of  +delayed_timing_checks  caused width and
       period timing check violations to be reported with incorrect event
       times.
     * In  some  cases  use  of +delayed_timing_checks with -fast or +opt
       caused  timing  check  condition  updates  to  be delayed by their
       delayed net delays.
     * In  some cases the simulator crashed when using a fork inside of a
       generate loop.
     * VHDL  configurations  referenced  from a Verilog configuration did
       not work correctly with the ":config" suffix.
     * In  some cases using constant functions in generate statements and
       in assign statements crashed the simulator.
     * In  some cases designs containing generate loops that instantiated
       modules   with   complex   usage   of  parameters  crashed  during
       elaboration.
     * External references inside of a generate loop caused vlog to crash
       when using -fast.
     * Environment  variables  were not expanded in Verilog configuration
       map files on win32.
     * A  global  variable  used  as  a  task actual output port inside a
       nested task caused an incorrect optimization.
     * Some  designs compiled with -fast resulted in an internal compiler
       error having "sig_allocatedOf(sig)" in the message text.
     * A  -fast  compiler  error occurred when a genvar was defined after
       the generate keyword.
     * Added  a  compiler  check  of  the  left-hand  side  of continuous
       assignments  for  a  non-constant  indexed part select of a vector
       net.
     * In  some  cases  the  simulator  crashed during design load when a
       named block appeared immediately after the "generate" keyword.
     * In  rare  cases,  incorrect  merging  of  gates  (vlog  -fast ...)
       resulted in incorrect simulation results.
     * There was a memory leak in tasks that contained event controls and
       calls to system tasks with complex arguments. Some examples of the
       system   function   calls   include   arithmetic  expressions  and
       bit-selects.
     * A  bit-select  of a 1-bit wide vector net connected to a primitive
       output  was  incorrectly  flagged  as  an error when compiled with
       -fast.
     * IOPATH statements (in SDF) were annotated to the primitive driving
       the  destination  port  if  a  corresponding  specify path was not
       found.  Now  vsim  issues an error message about the missing path.
       The  old  behavior  is  available  if  you  use  the  vsim  option
       +sdf_iopath_to_prim_ok.
     * vsim crashed during SDF annotation when compiled with -fast.
     * $setuphold  and  $recrem did not allow delay nets to be implicitly
       declared.
     * External  references used within system tasks and functions called
       from  within an automatic task or function failed with an internal
       error. The compiler now gives a more meaningful error message.
     * The  library  "work"  did  not  have  the same meaning for Verilog
       configurations  as  it  did in VHDL. This has been changed so that
       "work"  always  refers to the current working directory as it does
       in  VHDL.  It  is  recommended  that "work" not be used in Verilog
       configurations  since  configurations have their own set of search
       rules that make the use of work unnecessary.
     * A  register  modified with force/release or assign/deassign failed
       to  update correctly in some cases if the design was compiled with
       -fast.
     * The  simulator  crashed  when using a restart command if automatic
       variables  were  matched  by the wildcard used in the log command.
       For  example,  if  log  -r  /*  was  used  on  a design containing
       automatic  variables then the restart command caused the simulator
       to crash.
     * Using  +delayed_timing_checks,  on  a  design that contains an RTL
       block with timing checks, caused a crash in some cases.
     * A  delayed  non-blocking  assignment  failed to assign the correct
       value  in  some  cases  if  there  were  multiple  pending delayed
       non-blocking  assignments to the same target and if the design was
       compiled with -fast.
     * A  crash  occurred  when a module containing an interface instance
       was dropped in the Dataflow window.
     * Compiling with -cover exclude crashed if the source file contained
       certain expressions containing hierarchical references.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * The  PLI  acc  function  vl_obj_name() could return NULL. The code
       that calls this function has been modified to handle this case.
     * When using the VPI, if an iterator was freed by vpi_scan(), a call
       to   vpi_free_object()  on  that  iterator  is  illegal.  Although
       ModelSim  cannot flag this as an error in the general case, it can
       flag  many simple cases giving an error indicating that memory has
       already  been  freed.  Code  of  the  following  form  should have
       reported this error:
       while ( handle = vpi_scan(iterator) ) {
       /* do work here */
       }
       vpi_free_object(iterator); /* this is an error */
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * In  ModelSim  SE  only,  if  a  clocked  process  contained signal
       assignments  to  aggregates,  then  the  compiler  crashed in some
       cases.
     * Resolution  functions declared in architectures were not correctly
       accessing    globally    static   data   defined   in   the   same
       architecture/entity,  and  could  cause  the simulator to crash. A
       consequence  of this problem was that statement coverage performed
       on  architectures  with  resolution functions could also cause the
       simulator to crash.
     * Forces applied at time 0 were ignored by some optimized processes.
       The optimized processes were processes of the form:
       process ( clock)
       begin
       if ( clock = value AND clock'event)
       BODY
       endif;
       end process;
     * Array  size  mismatches  in  concurrent signal assignments weren't
       causing  a  fatal  error, resulting in a potential crash. An array
       size mismatch now raises a fatal error during elaboration.
     * The  simulator  could  crash  when describing or examining objects
       declared in the declaration region of IF GENERATE and FOR GENERATE
       blocks.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.8c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.8c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * If  an attempt is made to bind a misconstructed SystemC port to an
       HDL  signal,  ModelSim  will  now  issue a fatal elaboration error
       detailing the problem and its solution.
     * ModelSim  failed  to  correctly  name  local  signals in top-level
       SystemC modules.
     * vcom  produced an internal error while processing use clauses like
       "use lib.all;" with SystemC modules in "lib".
     * sccom produced an error when using C++ complex numbers.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * The  assertion  browser  and  assertion  commands could not locate
       assertions in generated VHDL instances.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * If   a   Verilog  module  instantiated  a  VHDL  model  that  then
       instantiated  another Verilog module, using the drivers command on
       ports  of  the lower level Verilog module crashed the simulator in
       some cases.
     * VHDL  input  and  inout  ports  of  type vltype (full Verilog wire
       values)  were  not  updated  correctly  when instantiated within a
       Verilog module.
     * The simulator crashed in some cases when doing a VCD dump.
     * Verilog  configurations that were loaded from a VHDL configuration
       incorrectly  required the design name of the Verilog configuration
       to be "vlogtop".
     * A  VHDL signal driven by multiple Verilog signals could resolve to
       an  incorrect  value if the Verilog signals changed simultaneously
       and were coming from Verilog primitives.
     * ModelSim  does not allow VHDL generics of type std_logic_vector on
       the  interface  from  Verilog  to VHDL. In previous releases, this
       restriction  was  not  enforced  and  the generic value was passed
       incorrectly. An error is now issued.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8c
     * ModelSim  failed  to  load  a design if the installation directory
       name contained spaces.
     * In  some  cases  the simulator crashed when invoked with condition
       coverage  or expression coverage turned on for a package body. The
       crash  usually occurred during elaboration or while generating the
       first coverage report.
     * The  coverage  reload  command  crashed  in some cases if the data
       being  loaded contained toggle data that was inconsistent with the
       design currently loaded. This could occur if the data being loaded
       had  extended  toggle  coverage  and the design in memory had only
       2-state  toggle  coverage,  or  if Verilog register widths did not
       match.
     * The  coverage save command with the -instance option in some cases
       failed to write out all of the design tree under that instance. It
       stopped  on  sub-instances that contained only other instances and
       no executable statements.
     * Under  certain  conditions,  virtual  signals  created  using  the
       concat_reverse  keyword displayed data in the Signals window or by
       the examine command that had missing bits.
     * vlog  failed  to  compile  with  expression  or condition coverage
       turned  on  when  an expression contained multiple subexpressions,
       one of which contained a reduction prefix operator.
     * Expression   coverage  caused  incorrect  simulation  results  for
       certain Verilog expressions. The expression must have contained an
       integer ANDed with a 32'h constant.
     * There  was  an error message order problem with wlf2log when there
       was  a  problem  reading  the input wlf file. This problem existed
       only on win32.
     * On  Windows,  the  vmap  command  would sometimes change the usual
       end-of-line  characters  (CR  LF)  to  just (LF) for the [library]
       section line that was modified.
     * On  Linux,  it was possible to have a stack limit violation during
       initialization. This problem was observed only on a "bigmem" linux
       kernel.
     * ModelSim  was unable to check out a keyless evaluation license for
       simulation since 5.8.
     * The  hppa64  version  of  the C Debug tool would not work reliably
       with the HP wdb/gdb 3.3 debugger.
     * The coverage clear -all command was not clearing toggle counts.
     * The  command  tcheck_status did not correctly report timing checks
       which   contained   the   COND  keyword.  The  associated  command
       tcheck_set  did  not  work correctly when timing checks containing
       the COND keyword were specified. Both issues occurred when the HDL
       source code was Verilog.

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.8c
     * DR 00158785 - When using -cosim or -slave mode the simulator would
       hang  during  initialization  if  given  a  filename as one of its
       arguments. It will now return an error.
     * DR   00148285  -  Problem  printing  in  paper  sizes  other  than
       letter-size (specific to the win32 platform).
     * DR  00160441 - ModelSim command "compare delete" very sensitive to
       user input.
       The  compare delete command was reporting too many or non-sensical
       errors and warnings. It will now ignore leading and trailing white
       space  in path names and not warn when removing compare items from
       the Wave or List window.
     * DR  00155884  -  Unresolved  reference message appears when design
       compiled -fast and simulating with -v2k_int_delays.
     * DR  00163573  -  Incorrect simulation results with 5.8 when forces
       are applied at time 0.
     * ER  00170260  -  Wave  Properties  dialog box not showing the full
       signal pathname in ModelSim5.8.
     * ER  00163866  -  Support  for  Verilog configurations calling VHDL
       configurations.
     * DR  00108426 - Opening a dataset while a sim is running causes sim
       to halt/hang.
     * DR  00142210 - vlog did not allow comments at the end of a `uselib
       directive correctly.
     * DR  00124756 - Cannot force a single bit of a wide net with a name
       containing $.
     * DR  00162163  -  Uppercase  Verilog  parameter does not match VHDL
       Generic.
     * DR  00162634  -  When  a Verilog module instantiates a VHDL entity
       with Verilog Parameters being passed from Verilog to VHDL Generics
       by   using  implicit  named  parameter  mapping  in  Verilog,  the
       simulator errors out with a Fatal error.
     * DR  00162757  -  Request  for 'verror' to support warning messages
       with "vsim-<4digit_number>" like error messages.
     * DR 00163043 - With refresh just the first cell will be compiled. (
       with -fast option ).
     * DR  00163863  -  ModelSim  v5.8  crashes  when running a mixed RTL
       language design.
     * DR 00172007 - Lose function of "i", "o", "l", "f", and "r" hotkeys
       intermittently.
     * ER 00164606 - WAVE: Incorrect bus value shown in Wave window.
     * DR 00166635 - SystemC crash.
     * DR 00167375 - Crash in PLI access of -fast library.
     * DR 00168083 - Bad Notebook page index in select method.
     * ER  00169900 - MSG: Warning if sdf used for timing outside SPECIFY
       BLOCKS in Verilog.
     * DR 00169961 - vsim crash if vcom option "-cover bsexc" is used.
     * DR 00170149 - Crash when optimizing a design.
     * DR  00146544  -  No  error  when using std_logic_vector as generic
       type.
     * DR 00170860 - Not same simulation results between 5.8b and 5.7g.
     * DR 00170861 - Internal error when using vcom command.
     * DR 00172005 - Ctrl-Left mouse button results in error message (not
       mouse mode zoom).

       is looking for non-existent library "vlogtop".
     * DR 00172479 - +delay_mode_zero and sdf : strange behavior.
     * DR 00170921 - Crash when opening memory window.
     * DR  00078599  - Problem opening new source with same name as found
       in  current  design.  The  problem  is with the edit command. If a
       simple  name  (e.g.  file.vhd)  is  given, the file in the current
       active  simulation  that  matches  is  used.  However,  if  a full
       pathname  is  given  (e.g.  /tmp/file.vhd),  then the full path as
       given will be used, ignoring any similar file in the design.

   Known Defects in 5.8c
     * Searching  for  signal  values  in the Wave or List window may not
       work  correctly  for VHDL arrays if the target value is in decimal
       notation.  You  may get an error that the value is of incompatible
       type,  or  the value may be interpreted using the incorrect radix.
       VHDL  does  not  have a radix indicator for decimal, but prefixing
       the  value  with  the  Verilog  notation  'd  should eliminate the
       problem, even if the signal is VHDL.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 5.8c
     * The  IEEE libraries numeric_bit and numeric_std have been added to
       the modeltech/ieeepure library.
     * The  C  Debug  tool  is  now supported in the hpux_ia64 version of
       ModelSim.  The  HP  wdb/gdb 4.2 debugger is used and packaged with
       ModelSim.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8c
     * A  new  command,  readers, has been added to find the readers of a
       specific  signal,  net, or port. Both readers and drivers commands
       can  be  accessed  from the Source window using Tools->Drivers and
       Tools->Readers.
     * A  new  option,  -recursive, has been added to the coverage report
       -instance  command. This will cause the full design tree under the
       specified  instance  to  be  reported  on.  It also supports using
       -lines and -totals for statement details or a top level summary.
     * A new option, -xml, has been added to the coverage report command.
       This  will  cause  the  data  to  be written out in XML format. An
       example  XML  style  sheet  is  provided  to  serve as a basis for
       developing  your  own translator. The file is covreport.xsl and is
       located  in  the  examples directory. For more details on the -xml
       option, see the ModelSim Command Reference.
     * The Verilog $coverage_save() system function has an optional third
       argument,  which  is  an integer, which when non-zero will turn on
       the -xml format option.
     * The  Wave  window  "Combine Selected Signals" dialog box has a new
       check  box  "Flatten  arrays";  unchecking  this  box  causes  the
       selected signals to be combined as fields in a record. This allows
       convenient  grouping  of signals. The virtual signal command has a
       new  keyword for implementing the feature, concat_noflatten. Also,
       an  existing  keyword,  concat_flatten,  now has a checkbox in the
       dialog  box,  which is labeled "Flatten records". If the base type
       of  each  record in the group is the same, this keyword causes the
       individual fields to be pulled up into one large bus.
     * The  Coverage  Report  dialog  has  two new options, Recursive and
       Write  XML Format, to support the -recursive and -xml command line
       options.
       The Coverage Load dialog has a new entry box, "Levels of Hierarchy
       to  Strip",  to  support the -strip command line option. Also, the
       Root Name entry has been changed to Install Path.
     * ModelSim  now  supports optimized Verilog cell port visibility and
       the vsim option -v2k_int_delays.
     * A  new  utility, wlf2vcd, was added which converts a WLF file to a
       VCD  file.  Complex data types that are not supportable in the VCD
       standard  (records,  memories,  etc)  are  not  converted but will
       generate a warning message. These warning messages can be filtered
       out with the -quiet switch.
     * The  Signals  window now displays the signal mode (In, Out, Inout,
       or Internal) for each signal.
     * The  Project  Compiler Settings dialog for Verilog now includes an
       option  to  select  Verilog  1995,  Verilog 2001, or SystemVerilog
       compatibility.
     * A  new option -depth d has been added to the log, nolog, add wave,
       and  add  list  commands, where d is an integer number equal to or
       greater  than  0.  The  depth  switch  will  restrict the level of
       hierarchy traversed to d where -depth 0 means the current level of
       hierarchy.  For  now , -depth is ignored if -r is not specified in
       the commands above.
     * The new TCL variable, WLFFilename, may be used to check or set the
       WLF  file  name.  The  file  name may be examined at any time, but
       changed  only  prior to creating the WLF file (by logging, waving,
       or  listing  items).  Once  the  WLF  file is opened the file name
       cannot  be  changed  and  a  warning will be returned. The 'report
       simulator   control'   command  will  also  return  the  value  of
       WLFFilename.
     * The new modelsim.ini variable, WLFFilename, can be used to set the
       default WLF file name. Note the vsim -wlf switch will override the
       ini setting.
     * A  new  option  (Export  EPS  File)  has  been  added to the Print
       Postscript dialog in the Wave window.
