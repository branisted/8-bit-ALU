<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 5.8 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>For Linux: 
<UL>
<LI>Linux is built on RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1. This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher. 
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60. 
<LI>RedHat 9.0 and RedHat Enterprise Workstation 3.0 are now supported (32-bit only).
<LI>AMD Opteron is now supported running SuSE SLES 9 (in 32-bit mode only). It is not recommended to run 32-bit ModelSim on versions of SuSE earlier than 9. 
<LI> Linux now supports large files. 
</UL>
<LI>For AIX:
<UL> 
<LI>AIX 5.2 is supported in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
<LI>rs64 is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1 and higher OS versions. 
<LI>rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
<LI>rs64 will support large files if you are using a JFS type file system and the large file option is enabled.
<LI>AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
</UL>
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.8 betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries" 
in the <i>ModelSim Installation & Licensing Guide</i> for more information on refreshing your models. 
</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 5.8c 
release. If you are migrating to the 5.8c release from 5.7x or earlier releases,
please also consult version 5.7x release notes for product changes and new 
features introduced during the 5.7 patch releases. The previous version 
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at 
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2.  The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2.  If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.  If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU zip format (.gz).  Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).  ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system version and C++ compiler version.  The OS support is slightly different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches -87, -93, or -2002, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features in vlog 5.8c: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
In waveform compare, if the flag to ignore Verilog strengths was not set, the comparison did not use the X-matching table, and required an exact match.</li>
<li>
The EDITOR environment variable on Windows could not handle backslashes.</li>
<li>
The child signals of PSL assertion directives now appear in the Wave window as individual elements of the parent directive.  Previously, these signals would be concatenated into flattened arrays.</li>
<li>
With toggle coverage enabled, the toggle coverage misses window would not display a bus correctly when only one bit of the bus was left uncovered (missed).</li>
<li>
A signal name was shortened in the Wave Properties dialog box if the name was too long. A balloon help popup containing the full signal name will now appear if the user moves the cursor over the shortened signal name.</li>
<li>
Opening a dataset during a run prevented the current simulation time from being displayed.</li>
<li>
Assertion signal names in the Wave window now respond correctly to the WaveSignalNameWidth variable setting.  This can be set in modelsim.ini or via the Wave window's preferences.</li>
<li>
The <b>[transcript file]</b> command failed when executed from a proc.</li>
<li>
The Execution option from the Project popup menu did not execute the do command in the proper scope causing global variables to be invisible.</li>
<li>
The i, o, l, f, and r hotkeys in the Wave window intermittently stopped working.</li>
<li>
There was a Wave window problem where using the Control key with the left mouse button to perform Wave window zooming resulted in a TCL traceback starting with the following line: <br>
<i>Trace back: can't read "vsimPriv(.mZ:grid)": no such element in array</i>
</li>
<li>
When saving an edited source file when the file pathname contained spaces, a Tcl error occurred. This is a Unix only issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
vlog erroneously attempted to scan <b>-v</b> libraries during a <b>-refresh</b>.</li>
<li>
vlog issued an error for multiply defined modules. This was changed to a warning and the last module defined is now used.</li>
<li>
An explicitly typed parameter failed to retain the explicit type when compiled with <b>-fast</b>. The type was taken from the final value assigned to the parameter.</li>
<li>
Extraneous compile errors coming from inactive conditional
generate branches were removed (<b>-fast</b> mode only).</li>
<li>
Refreshing an optimized design in some cases left one or more UDPs unrefreshed.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command now accepts string data for Verilog
registers (e.g. change reg1 \"newstringvalue\").
</li>
<li>
Non-blocking assignments to automatic variables were not reported as errors when no delay or event control was used.  This is now reported as an error.</li>
<li>
Named parameter assignment to VHDL generics is now case insensitive.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when a VHDL configuration at the top level of a design
contained Verilog modules with generate constructs.</li>
<li>
In some cases use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> caused width and period timing check violations to be reported with incorrect event times.</li>
<li>
In some cases use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> with <b>-fast</b> or <b>+opt</b> caused timing check condition updates to be delayed by their delayed net delays.</li>
<li>
In some cases the simulator crashed when using a fork inside of a generate loop.</li>
<li>
VHDL configurations referenced from a Verilog configuration did not work correctly with the ":config" suffix. </li>
<li>
In some cases using constant functions in generate statements and in assign statements crashed the simulator.</li>
<li>
In some cases designs containing generate loops that instantiated modules with complex
usage of parameters crashed during elaboration.
</li>
<li>
External references inside of a generate loop caused vlog to crash when using <b>-fast</b>.
</li>
<li>
Environment variables were not expanded in Verilog configuration map files on win32.</li>
<li>
A global variable used as a task actual output port inside a nested task caused
an incorrect optimization.</li>
<li>
Some designs compiled with <b>-fast</b> resulted in an internal compiler error having "sig_allocatedOf(sig)" in the message text.</li>
<li>
A <b>-fast</b> compiler error occurred when a genvar was defined after the
generate keyword.
</li>
<li>
Added a compiler check of the left-hand side of continuous assignments
for a non-constant indexed part select of a vector net.
</li>
<li>
In some cases the simulator crashed during design load when a named block appeared
immediately after the "generate" keyword.</li>
<li>
In rare cases, incorrect merging of gates (vlog -fast ...) resulted in incorrect simulation results.</li>
<li>
There was a memory leak in tasks that contained event controls and calls to system tasks with complex arguments. Some examples of the system function calls include arithmetic expressions and bit-selects.</li>
<li>
A bit-select of a 1-bit wide vector net connected to a primitive output was incorrectly flagged as an error when compiled with <b>-fast</b>.</li>
<li>
IOPATH statements (in SDF) were annotated to the primitive driving the destination port if a corresponding specify path was not found. Now vsim issues an error message about the missing path. The old behavior is available if you use the vsim option <b>+sdf_iopath_to_prim_ok</b>.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed during SDF annotation when compiled with <b>-fast</b>.</li>
<li>
$setuphold and $recrem did not allow delay nets to be implicitly declared.</li>
<li>
External references used within system tasks and functions called from within an automatic task or function failed with an internal error.  The compiler now gives a more meaningful error message.</li>
<li>
The library "work" did not have the same meaning for Verilog configurations as it did in VHDL. This has been changed so that "work" always refers to the current working directory as it does in VHDL. It is recommended that "work" not be used in Verilog configurations since configurations have their own set of search rules that make the use of work unnecessary.
</li>
<li>
A register modified with force/release or assign/deassign failed to update correctly in some cases if the design was compiled with <b>-fast</b>.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when using a <b>restart</b> command if automatic variables were matched by the wildcard used in the <b>log</b> command.  For example, if <b>log -r /*</b> was used on a design containing automatic variables then the <b>restart</b> command caused the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
Using <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b>, on a design that contains an RTL block with timing checks, caused a crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
A delayed non-blocking assignment failed to assign the correct value in some cases if there were multiple pending delayed non-blocking assignments to the same target and if the design was compiled with <b>-fast</b>.</li>
<li>
A crash occurred when a module containing an interface instance was dropped in the Dataflow window.</li>
<li>
Compiling with <b>-cover exclude</b> crashed if the source file contained certain expressions containing hierarchical references.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The PLI acc function vl_obj_name() could return NULL. The code that calls this function has been modified to handle this case.</li>
<li>
When using the VPI, if an iterator was freed by vpi_scan(), a call to vpi_free_object() on that iterator is illegal.  Although ModelSim cannot
flag this as an error in the general case, it can flag many simple cases
giving an error indicating that memory has already been freed. Code of the
following form should have reported this error:<BR>
<code>
while ( handle = vpi_scan(iterator) ) {<BR>
  /* do work here */<BR>
}<BR>
vpi_free_object(iterator);  /* this is an error */
</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
In ModelSim SE only, if a clocked process contained signal assignments to aggregates, then the compiler crashed in some cases.</li>
<li>
Resolution functions declared in architectures were not correctly accessing globally static data defined in the same architecture/entity, and could cause the simulator to crash. A consequence of this problem was that statement coverage performed on architectures with resolution functions could also cause the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
Forces applied at time 0 were ignored by some optimized processes. The optimized processes were processes of the form: <BR>
<code>
process ( clock) <BR>
begin <BR>
 if ( clock = value AND clock'event) <BR>
    BODY<BR>
  endif; <BR>
end process;<BR>
</code></li>
<li>
Array size mismatches in concurrent signal assignments weren't causing a fatal error, resulting in a potential crash.  An array size mismatch now raises a fatal error during elaboration.</li>
<li>
The simulator could crash when describing or examining objects declared
in the declaration region of IF GENERATE and FOR GENERATE blocks.</li>
</ul>

If an attempt is made to bind a misconstructed SystemC port to an HDL signal, ModelSim will now issue a fatal elaboration error detailing the problem and its solution.</li>
<li>
ModelSim failed to correctly name local signals in top-level SystemC modules.</li>
<li>
vcom produced an internal error while processing use clauses like "use lib.all;" with SystemC modules in "lib".</li>

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a Verilog module instantiated a VHDL model that then instantiated another
Verilog module, using the <b>drivers</b> command on ports of the lower level Verilog module crashed the simulator in some cases.</li>
<li>
VHDL input and inout ports of type vltype (full Verilog wire values) were not updated correctly when instantiated within a Verilog module. </li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in some cases when doing a VCD dump.</li>
<li>
Verilog configurations that were loaded from a VHDL configuration incorrectly required the design name of the Verilog configuration to be "vlogtop".</li>
<li>
A VHDL signal driven by multiple Verilog signals could resolve to an incorrect value if the Verilog signals changed simultaneously and were coming from Verilog primitives.</li>
<li>
ModelSim does not allow VHDL generics of type std_logic_vector on the interface from Verilog to VHDL. In previous releases, this restriction was not enforced and the generic value was passed incorrectly. An error is now issued.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
ModelSim failed to load a design if the installation directory name contained spaces.</li>
<li>
In some cases the simulator crashed when invoked with condition coverage or expression coverage turned on for a package body. The crash usually occurred during elaboration or while generating the first coverage report.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage reload</b> command crashed in some cases if the data being loaded 
contained toggle data that was inconsistent with the design currently loaded. 
This could occur if the data being loaded had extended toggle coverage and the design in memory had only 2-state toggle coverage, or if Verilog register widths did not match.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage save</b> command with the <b>-instance</b> option in some cases failed to write out all of the design tree under that instance. It stopped on sub-instances that contained only other instances and no executable statements.</li>
<li>
Under certain conditions, virtual signals created using the concat_reverse
keyword displayed data in the Signals window or by the <b>examine</b> command
that had missing bits.</li>
<li>
vlog failed to compile with expression or condition coverage turned on when an
expression contained multiple subexpressions, one of which contained a reduction prefix operator.</li>
<li>
Expression coverage caused incorrect simulation results for certain Verilog expressions. The expression must have contained an integer ANDed with a 32'h constant.</li>
<li>
There was an error message order problem with wlf2log when there was a problem reading the input wlf file. This problem existed only on win32.</li>
<li>
On Windows, the vmap command would sometimes change the usual end-of-line
characters (CR LF) to just (LF) for the [library] section
line that was modified.</li>
<li>
On Linux, it was possible to have a stack limit violation during initialization.  This problem was observed only on a "bigmem" linux kernel.</li>
<li>
ModelSim was unable to check out a keyless evaluation license for simulation since 5.8.</li>
<li>
The hppa64 version of the C Debug tool would not work reliably with the HP wdb/gdb 3.3 debugger.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage clear -all</b> command was not clearing toggle counts. </li>
<li>
The command tcheck_status did not correctly report timing checks which contained the COND keyword.  The associated command tcheck_set did not work correctly when timing checks containing the COND keyword were specified.  Both issues occurred when the HDL source code was Verilog.</li>
</ul>

DR 00078599 - Problem opening new source with same name as found in current design.  The problem is with the <b>edit</b> command.  If a simple name (e.g. file.vhd) is given, the file in the current active simulation that matches is used.  However, if a full pathname is given (e.g. /tmp/file.vhd), then the full path as given will be used, ignoring any similar file in the design.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Searching for signal values in the Wave or List window may not
work correctly for VHDL arrays if the target value is in decimal
notation. You may get an error that the value is of incompatible
type, or the value may be interpreted using the incorrect radix. 
VHDL does not have a radix indicator for decimal, but prefixing
the value with the Verilog notation 'd should eliminate the problem,
even if the signal is VHDL.</li>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The IEEE libraries numeric_bit and numeric_std have been added to the modeltech/ieeepure library.</li>
<li>
The C Debug tool is now supported in the hpux_ia64 version of ModelSim. The HP wdb/gdb 4.2 debugger is used and packaged with ModelSim.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 5.8c</b>
<ul>
<li>
A new command, <b>readers</b>, has been added to find the readers of a specific signal, net, or port. Both <b>readers</b> and <b>drivers</b> commands can be accessed from the Source window using Tools->Drivers and Tools->Readers.</li>
<li>
A new option, <b>-recursive</b>, has been added to the <b>coverage report -instance</b>
command. This will cause the full design tree under the specified instance
to be reported on. It also supports using <b>-lines</b> and <b>-totals</b> for statement details or a top level summary.</li>
<li>
A new option, <b>-xml</b>, has been added to the <b>coverage report</b> command. This will cause the data to be written out in XML format. An example XML style sheet is provided to serve as a basis for developing your own translator. The file is covreport.xsl and is located in the examples directory. For more details on the <b>-xml</b> option, see the ModelSim Command Reference.</li>
<li>
The Verilog $coverage_save() system function has an optional third argument,
which is an integer, which when non-zero will turn on the <b>-xml</b> format option.</li>
<li>
The Wave window "Combine Selected Signals" dialog box has a new check box
"Flatten arrays"; unchecking this box causes the selected signals to be
combined as fields in a record. This allows convenient grouping of signals. The 
<b>virtual signal</b> command has a new keyword for implementing the feature, 
<b>concat_noflatten</b>. Also, an existing keyword, <b>concat_flatten</b>, now 
has a checkbox in the dialog box, which is labeled "Flatten records". If the
base type of each record in the group is the same, this keyword causes the
individual fields to be pulled up into one large bus.</li>
<li>
The Coverage Report dialog has two new options, Recursive and Write XML Format, to support the <b>-recursive</b> and <b>-xml</b> command line options.<br>
The Coverage Load dialog has a new entry box, "Levels of Hierarchy to Strip", to support the <b>-strip</b> command line option. Also, the Root Name entry has been changed to Install Path.<br>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim now supports optimized Verilog cell port visibility and the vsim
option <b>-v2k_int_delays</b>.</li>
<li>
A new utility, <b>wlf2vcd</b>, was added which converts a WLF file to a VCD file.  Complex data types that are not supportable in the VCD standard (records, memories, etc) are not converted but will generate a warning message. These warning messages can be filtered out with the <b>-quiet</b> switch.</li>
<li>
The Signals window now displays the signal mode (In, Out, Inout, or Internal) for each signal.</li>
<li>
The Project Compiler Settings dialog for Verilog now includes an option to select Verilog 1995, Verilog 2001, or SystemVerilog compatibility.</li>
<li>
A new option <b>-depth d</b> has been added to the <b>log</b>, <b>nolog</b>, <b>add wave</b>, and <b>add list</b> commands, where d is an integer number equal to or greater than 0. The depth switch will restrict the level of hierarchy traversed to d where <b>-depth 0</b> means the current level of hierarchy. For now , <b>-depth</b> is ignored if <b>-r</b> is not specified in the commands above.</li>
<li>
The new TCL variable, <b>WLFFilename</b>, may be used to check or set the WLF file name.  The file name may be examined at any time, but changed only prior to creating the WLF file (by logging, waving, or listing items). Once the WLF file is opened the file name cannot be changed and a warning will be returned.  The 'report simulator control' command will also return the value of WLFFilename.</li>
<li>
The new modelsim.ini variable, WLFFilename, can be used to set the default WLF file name.  Note the vsim <b>-wlf</b> switch will override the ini setting.</li>
<li>
A new option (Export EPS File) has been added to the Print Postscript dialog in the Wave window.</li>
