<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>64-bit ModelSim is supported on the AMD64 and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.8x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the ModelSim User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 6.0d
release. If you are migrating to the 6.0d release from 6.0x, 5.8x or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x and 5.8x release notes for product changes and new features introduced during the 6.0x and 5.8x releases. The previous version release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2.  The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2.  If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.  If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU zip format (.gz).  Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).  ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system version and C++ compiler version.  The OS support is slightly different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches -87, -93, or -2002, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>readers</b> command for a single bit of a bus signal was showing the readers of complete bus.</li>
<li>
There was a problem related to adding new files to a project. The file type is now correctly saved by the project and reflected in the Project window.</li>
<li>
vsim exited without any useful information if the command line option <b>+nowarnMSGTYPE</b> was specified on the vsim command line, and MSGTYPE was not a known message mnemonic.  Unknown message mnemonics are now treated the same way as unknown plusargs (the behavior will vary based on the CheckPlusargs modelsim.ini setting).</li>
<li>
A text editor crashed during a FIND and REPLACE operation.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with the Create Testbench wizard (in the source templates) where a TCL stacktrace occurred while creating a VHDL use clause for the testbench.</li>
<li>
The Window->Cascade, Window->Tile Horizontal, and Window->Tile Vertical menu items did not properly arrange all top-level windows. Undocked window panes were skipped.</li>
<li>
ModelSim failed to use the EDITOR environment variable if it contained a space.</li>
<li>
On Windows, ModelSim failed to recognize file type registration for other tools and used the source editor instead.</li>
<li>
Some Source window font settings were not saved correctly between sessions.</li>
<li>
Memory Compare on Windows was not working properly when vsim was invoked via a shortcut (icon).</li>
<li>
The Iconify Children, Iconify All, and Deiconify All features were not working properly. The behavior of these functions has changed to the following: when linkWindows is true, the child windows are no longer withdrawn when the main window is minimized; instead, the windows are simply minimized.</li>
<li>
In the Edit Preference dialog box, under the By Name tab, the names Signals and Variables were displayed. The names were corrected to be Objects and Locals, respectively.</li>
<li>
The <b>noview</b> command wildcards did not close all the windows matching the pattern and would sometimes close the wrong window.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when docking the Watch window with grouped items. </li>
<li>
There was a GUI update problems for the dynamic memory in both memory list and memory data pane.</li>
<li>
Single stepping in the C Debug tool auto step mode displayed the wrong source file and line.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with key board accelerators in the Wave window.  Keys f, i, etc. were not modifying zoom properly when the Wave window was activated.</li>
<li>
When forcing a register bit or slice no error message was issued in the transcript window. Forcing a register bit or slice is not permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Expressions of the form "a==b" in some cases incorrectly evaluated to 1'bx in optimized designs, if one of the operands was a compile-time constant containing X or Z values and other contains known values.
</li>
<li>
Assignments with a LHS wider than 32 bits, and with a smaller RHS which evaluated to all X's, sometimes did not show X's in all bits of the LHS in an optimized design.
</li>
<li>
Error and warning reporting while using condition coverage with the <b>-source</b> option crashed the simulator in some cases.</li>
<li>
$fread() was not triggering events when loading memories.  Now an event
control (eg. "always @(mem[0])") will execute when $fread() loads "mem".
</li>
<li>
The vlog compiler would sometimes hang when compiling a task or function with assignment statements where the target of the assignments was a concatenation of hierarchical references.</li>
<li>
The <b>virtual signal</b> command did not work with optimized Verilog cell ports.</li>
<li>
In optimized designs, sometimes a value forced onto an instance port would incorrectly be applied to ports of other instances.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed with corrupted memory if branch code coverage was on and a Verilog case statement has a case alternative that is not a constant, such as a parameter.</li>
<li>
Code coverage was not working inside Verilog interface blocks.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with the right shift operator when the RHS was very large number.</li>
<li>
The unary reduction operators produced incorrect results in some unusual cases.</li>
<li>
If the source for a $init_signal_spy_driver task was a vector register, the
target object was never updated.</li>
<li>
The arithmetic operators produced incorrect results in some unusual cases.</li>
<li>
Usage of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> caused tcheck_status to display delayed net names in the timing checks.</li>
<li>
Unoptimized cells could have false no-solution found errors with negative timing checks.</li>
<li>
vlog allowed variable initialization with non-constant expressions which is illegal.

</li>
<li>
Some interactions of generate loops and parameter caused fatal errors.</li>

<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
If the user defined their own functions named rising_edge and falling_edge incorrect optimization occurred in some cases.</li>
<li>
Files declared in protected type bodies now work properly.</li>
<li>
Clocked-process optimization was erroneously applied to a process when there were signals assigned in the reset part of the IF statement that did not appear in the non-reset part.</li>
<li>
Optimization levels greater than <b>-02</b> caused time zero drivers of signals to not occur i some cases.</li>
<li>
If a portion of a bus was forced then later other bits or the whole bus was
forced, incorrect values were reported in the Wave window.  The <b>examine</b>
command and the simulator had correct values, but the wlf file had incorrect values in some cases.</li>
<li>
If a foreign function was compiled in VHDL 93 or higher and not marked impure, incorrect optimizations occurred in some cases resulting in the foreign function being called out of order. If the foreign function had no side-effects and did not have external states there were no problems. If the function did have side-effects or had internal states, then errors occurred in the simulation.</li>
<li>
Slow elaboration time occurred if a port is a large resolved composite.  It
could take tens of minutes per port.  The time is now less than a second.</li>
<li>
If a generic on a component was left explicitly OPEN and that generic was used
to determine port sizes on the entity, then an error about cg bad operand
occurred.</li>
<li>
If a signal declared in a package is used in another package in a wait statement,
or a signal argument to a subprogram, bad code was generated in some cases.</li>
<li>
If an invalid selected name was used as a component name, the error message sometimes reported "UNKNOWN" as the component name.</li>
<li>
There was a problem generating correct code inside a for loop in a method.
</li>
<li>
Alias with subtype indication, that denotes an array type, class signal, mode OUT formal subprogram parameter was not being initialized properly.</li>
<li>
Illegal code was generated in port maps using configuration
specifications when the formal was an array, individual subelement
association was used to map the formal to the local, and the local was
unassociated or unconnected.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in some cases when a subprogram containing a local array was inlined within another subprogram, which itself was inlined within another.</li>
<li>
vcom went into an infinite loop with the <b>-source</b> switch if the source file had an error on the last line.</li>
<li>
Very long identifiers (> 1024 chars) in SDF instance names crashed the simulator.</li>
<li>
An error is detected if a single command line VHDL generic is used for two different types.
</li>
<li>
Inling of function call whose parameter arguments used named association were not handled correctly.</li>
<li>
Incorrect code was generated for VHDL concurrent signal assignment statements which contained a slice with a signal value as part of the slice. This problem only occurred when the concurrent signal assignment was inside a block statement or a generate statement.

For older releases, the workaround is to replace the concurrent signal assignment with its equivalent process.</li>
<li>
If a clocked VHDL process that read a signal and a portion of that signal
appeared in the sensitivity list the process may fail to update the outputs
correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
When encountering generics of type RECORD, mti_GetGenericList would produce an error and also exit ModelSim.  mti_GetGenericList has been modified to not exit ModelSim but will continue to produce an error when a generic of type RECORD is encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a simulation with a SDF file that had annotations to timing checks in VITAL instances was run with <b>+notimingchecks</b>, spurious error messages were issued about missing timing checks.
</li>
<li>
If a VITAL module had iopaths defined between two vector ports, the SDF annotator required that at least the paths between the two LSBs and the two MSBs be specified. This artificial restriction was removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>nolog</b> command was not always working for SystemC ports.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with users being unable to see compilation errors from sccom during creation of debug database on Windows only. </li>
<li>
There was a reported time overflow problem with event notification and wait statements.</li>
<li>
sccom crashed when linking in a design library with no systemC objects.</li>

<li>
There was incorrect behavior when an element of a sere intersect was a boolean expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Individual association in a port map of a VHDL-instantiates-Verilog instance,
when the individual association elements for an array port contained both constants (literals) and signals, did not result in the constant/literal portion being propagated to the Verilog module correctly.</li>
<li>
When the simulator elaborated a design that used a VHDL configuration and Verilog UDPs, it potentially leaked a large amount of memory.</li>
<li>
In a mixed language simulation, SDF annotator complained about a missing VHDL instance, when in reality it was the VITAL generics that were missing from that instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
vsim in some cases crashed with corrupted memory if
branch code coverage was on and a Verilog case statement had a case alternative 
that was not a constant, such as a parameter.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed when signal_force() or $signal_force()  was used with the <b>restart</b> command.

</li>
<li>
vsim sometimes produced the error "Internal Error in add_line_object_rec".</li>
<li>
Modelsim now generates an error message if <b>-c</b> and <b>-i</b> are specified together on the vsim command line.</li>
<li>
A GUI crash on Windows left an orphaned <i>vlm.exe</i> process running.</li>
<li>
Using CTRL-C to break a command line simulation running on Windows caused a crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
The WLFDeleteOnQuit modelsim.ini variable did not work.</li>
<li>
In cases where a Startup command was specified in the ini file and a design unit
was not given on the vsim command line the Startup command was ignored.</li>
<li>
When <b>-cover c</b> was specified to vlog, long expressions in the Verilog code caused vlog to crash some cases. </li>
<li>
The use of the <b>-filemap_elab</b> vsim switch caused the simulation to crash in certain situations.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with vcd2wlf having to do with $scope statements which are hierarchical references (i.e. "top.cpu.u23").</li>
<li>
A new random number generator was added for memory words more than 32 bits wide.  mem load with filltype 'random' now fills all the bits of a wide memory word and not just the low 32 bits.</li>
<li>
The simulator failed with a malloc error when loading a design on Red Hat Enterprise linux release 3.</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> switch caused a crash due
to searching for timing checks to move to the delayed net
on the wrong nets and when failing to find them, returning a
bad value.</li>

<li>
This is a clarification of the ordering of toggle nodes presented by the <b>toggle
report</b> command. If you use a signal list argument wildcard, such as 
<b>toggle report -all -r /*</b>, the order will be the order signals are found
when searching down the context tree using the wildcard, and multiple elements
of the same net will be listed multiple times. If you do not use a
wildcard, such as <b>toggle report -all -r</b>, the nodes will be listed in the
order in which they were originally added to toggle coverage, and there will be
no duplication.</li>
<li>
Toggle nodes passed to vcover through the <b>coverage save</b> command now
use the top element of a multi-segment net.</li>
<li>
When determining the current working directory on unix systems the PWD environment variable is examined to determine if it points to the same location. If so it's value is used. This applies to vlib, vcom, vlog, and vsim.</li>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.0d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>coverage save</b> command has a new option <b>-onexit</b>, which when
specified will cause the command to be executed when the simulator exits.</li>
<li>
The <b>toggle report</b> command has a new option <b>-onexit</b>, which when
specified causes the command to be executed when the simulator exits.</li>
<li>
The <b>toggle add</b> command has a new option <b>-exclude {&lt;list&gt;}</b>
which specifies that bits of a bus be excluded from toggle computations and
reports. &lt;list&gt; is a space-separated list of integers or ranges, where
a range is two integers separated by either ":" or "-". The range must be in
the same ascending or descending order as the signal declaration. If a second
<b>toggle add -exclude</b> command is issued on the same signal, the latest 
command will override the earlier one.</li>
<li>
The <b>view</b> and <b>noview</b> commands have been enhanced to handle all windows.  They can be used to open and close these additional windows: Missed (missed coverage), Exclusions (coverage exclusions), Details (coverage details), and Instances (instance coverage).  The <b>noview</b> command can also be used to close Source windows using the tab name or file name. It can also be used to close windows by class, for example, to close all Memory windows, use <b>noview Memory</b>.  Valid classes are Source, Memory, and Wave.</li>
<li>
We have added a <b>-unique</b> option to the <b>toggle report</b> command.
This eliminates duplicate listings for multiple ports connected to the
same net.</li>
<li>
We have added a <b>-top</b> option to the <b>toggle report</b> command.
For signals that were added to toggle coverage using the <b>vcom</b> or
<b>vlog -cover t</b> option, the <b>-top</b> option will use the name
of the topmost element of multiple-segment (collapsed) nets. Otherwise
the name of the wildcard-matching segment will be used.</li>
<li>
The <b>vcover report</b> command has a new option 
<b>-excluded [-user|-pragma][-do]</b>. This will report the exclusions in the
specified coverage database input file. It will report both user exclusions
and source code pragma exclusions unless <b>-user</b> or <b>-pragma</b> is
specified. If <b>-do</b> is specified, it will report in do-file command
format. </li>
<li>
The <b>vcover</b> command has a new mode <b>vcover rank</b> which will rank
the specified inputs according to their contribution to cumulative coverage,
in the order specified. It does not try to change the ordering. This can be
used with the <b>-inputs &lt;filename&gt;</b> option to place a list of files
in file &lt;filename&gt;. </li>
<li>
We have added a <b>vcom -coverNoSub</b> option to turn off code coverage
in VHDL subprograms. Otherwise code coverage is on in VHDL subprograms.</li>
