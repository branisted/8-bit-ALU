   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + 64-bit ModelSim is supported on the AMD64 and compatible processors
            running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux
            WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The ModelSim profiling
            feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the
            linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these
            systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       5.8x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries"  in  the ModelSim User's Manual for more information on
       refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the
       6.0d release. If you are migrating to the 6.0d release from 6.0x, 5.8x
       or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x and 5.8x release
       notes for product changes and new features introduced during the 6.0x
       and 5.8x releases. The previous version release notes can be found in
       your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim 5.7
       release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please
       note  that  in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and
       executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled
       and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to
       version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that
       the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 8.2. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server
       and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this
       release. If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files
       compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU
       zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files
       that are created only with GNU zip (gzip). ModelSim does not require the
       file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z
       extension.
     * ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system
       version and C++ compiler version. The OS support is slightly different
       than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also,
       64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version 5.8b and
            greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim versions 6.0 and greater)
     * ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and
       SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * The readers command for a single bit of a bus signal was showing the
       readers of complete bus.
     * There was a problem related to adding new files to a project. The file
       type is now correctly saved by the project and reflected in the Project
       window.
     * vsim exited without any useful information if the command line option
       +nowarnMSGTYPE was specified on the vsim command line, and MSGTYPE was
       not a known message mnemonic. Unknown message mnemonics are now treated
       the same way as unknown plusargs (the behavior will vary based on the
       CheckPlusargs modelsim.ini setting).
     * A text editor crashed during a FIND and REPLACE operation.
     * There was a problem with the Create Testbench wizard (in the source
       templates) where a TCL stacktrace occurred while creating a VHDL use
       clause for the testbench.
     * The Window->Cascade, Window->Tile Horizontal, and Window->Tile Vertical
       menu items did not properly arrange all top-level windows. Undocked
       window panes were skipped.
     * ModelSim failed to use the EDITOR environment variable if it contained a
       space.
     * On Windows, ModelSim failed to recognize file type registration for
       other tools and used the source editor instead.
     * Some  Source window font settings were not saved correctly between
       sessions.
     * Memory Compare on Windows was not working properly when vsim was invoked
       via a shortcut (icon).
     * The Iconify Children, Iconify All, and Deiconify All features were not
       working properly. The behavior of these functions has changed to the
       following: when linkWindows is true, the child windows are no longer
       withdrawn when the main window is minimized; instead, the windows are
       simply minimized.
     * In the Edit Preference dialog box, under the By Name tab, the names
       Signals and Variables were displayed. The names were corrected to be
       Objects and Locals, respectively.
     * The noview command wildcards did not close all the windows matching the
       pattern and would sometimes close the wrong window.
     * The simulator crashed when docking the Watch window with grouped items.
     * There was a GUI update problems for the dynamic memory in both memory
       list and memory data pane.
     * Single stepping in the C Debug tool auto step mode displayed the wrong
       source file and line.
     * There was a problem with key board accelerators in the Wave window. Keys
       f, i, etc. were not modifying zoom properly when the Wave window was
       activated.
     * When forcing a register bit or slice no error message was issued in the
       transcript window. Forcing a register bit or slice is not permitted.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * Expressions of the form "a==b" in some cases incorrectly evaluated to
       1'bx in optimized designs, if one of the operands was a compile-time
       constant containing X or Z values and other contains known values.
     * Assignments with a LHS wider than 32 bits, and with a smaller RHS which
       evaluated to all X's, sometimes did not show X's in all bits of the LHS
       in an optimized design.
     * Error and warning reporting while using condition coverage with the
       -source option crashed the simulator in some cases.
     * $fread() was not triggering events when loading memories. Now an event
       control (eg. "always @(mem[0])") will execute when $fread() loads "mem".
     * The vlog compiler would sometimes hang when compiling a task or function
       with assignment statements where the target of the assignments was a
       concatenation of hierarchical references.
     * The virtual signal command did not work with optimized Verilog cell
       ports.
     * In optimized designs, sometimes a value forced onto an instance port
       would incorrectly be applied to ports of other instances.
     * The simulator crashed with corrupted memory if branch code coverage was
       on and a Verilog case statement has a case alternative that is not a
       constant, such as a parameter.
     * Code coverage was not working inside Verilog interface blocks.
     * There was a problem with the right shift operator when the RHS was very
       large number.
     * The unary reduction operators produced incorrect results in some unusual
       cases.
     * If the source for a $init_signal_spy_driver task was a vector register,
       the target object was never updated.
     * The arithmetic operators produced incorrect results in some unusual
       cases.
     * Usage of +delayed_timing_checks caused tcheck_status to display delayed
       net names in the timing checks.
     * Unoptimized  cells  could have false no-solution found errors with
       negative timing checks.
     * vlog allowed variable initialization with non-constant expressions which
       is illegal.
     * Some interactions of generate loops and parameter caused fatal errors.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0d
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * If  the  user  defined  their  own functions named rising_edge and
       falling_edge incorrect optimization occurred in some cases.
     * Files declared in protected type bodies now work properly.
     * Clocked-process optimization was erroneously applied to a process when
       there were signals assigned in the reset part of the IF statement that
       did not appear in the non-reset part.
     * Optimization levels greater than -02 caused time zero drivers of signals
       to not occur i some cases.
     * If a portion of a bus was forced then later other bits or the whole bus
       was forced, incorrect values were reported in the Wave window. The
       examine command and the simulator had correct values, but the wlf file
       had incorrect values in some cases.
     * If a foreign function was compiled in VHDL 93 or higher and not marked
       impure, incorrect optimizations occurred in some cases resulting in the
       foreign function being called out of order. If the foreign function had
       no side-effects and did not have external states there were no problems.
       If the function did have side-effects or had internal states, then
       errors occurred in the simulation.
     * Slow elaboration time occurred if a port is a large resolved composite.
       It could take tens of minutes per port. The time is now less than a
       second.
     * If a generic on a component was left explicitly OPEN and that generic
       was used to determine port sizes on the entity, then an error about cg
       bad operand occurred.
     * If a signal declared in a package is used in another package in a wait
       statement, or a signal argument to a subprogram, bad code was generated
       in some cases.
     * If an invalid selected name was used as a component name, the error
       message sometimes reported "UNKNOWN" as the component name.
     * There was a problem generating correct code inside a for loop in a
       method.
     * Alias with subtype indication, that denotes an array type, class signal,
       mode OUT formal subprogram parameter was not being initialized properly.
     * Illegal  code  was  generated  in  port  maps  using configuration
       specifications when the formal was an array, individual subelement
       association was used to map the formal to the local, and the local was
       unassociated or unconnected.
     * The simulator crashed in some cases when a subprogram containing a local
       array was inlined within another subprogram, which itself was inlined
       within another.
     * vcom went into an infinite loop with the -source switch if the source
       file had an error on the last line.
     * Very long identifiers (> 1024 chars) in SDF instance names crashed the
       simulator.
     * An error is detected if a single command line VHDL generic is used for
       two different types.
     * Inling of function call whose parameter arguments used named association
       were not handled correctly.
     * Incorrect code was generated for VHDL concurrent signal assignment
       statements which contained a slice with a signal value as part of the
       slice. This problem only occurred when the concurrent signal assignment
       was  inside  a  block statement or a generate statement. For older
       releases, the workaround is to replace the concurrent signal assignment
       with its equivalent process.
     * If a clocked VHDL process that read a signal and a portion of that
       signal appeared in the sensitivity list the process may fail to update
       the outputs correctly.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * When encountering generics of type RECORD, mti_GetGenericList would
       produce an error and also exit ModelSim. mti_GetGenericList has been
       modified to not exit ModelSim but will continue to produce an error when
       a generic of type RECORD is encountered.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * If a simulation with a SDF file that had annotations to timing checks in
       VITAL instances was run with +notimingchecks, spurious error messages
       were issued about missing timing checks.
     * If a VITAL module had iopaths defined between two vector ports, the SDF
       annotator required that at least the paths between the two LSBs and the
       two MSBs be specified. This artificial restriction was removed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * The nolog command was not always working for SystemC ports.
     * There was a problem with users being unable to see compilation errors
       from sccom during creation of debug database on Windows only.
     * There was a reported time overflow problem with event notification and
       wait statements.
     * sccom crashed when linking in a design library with no systemC objects.
     * There was a problem in sccom with ordering of user include paths.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * There was a problem with prev(sig,N) optimization.
     * There was incorrect behavior when an element of a sere intersect was a
       boolean expression.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * Individual association in a port map of a VHDL-instantiates-Verilog
       instance, when the individual association elements for an array port
       contained both constants (literals) and signals, did not result in the
       constant/literal  portion  being  propagated to the Verilog module
       correctly.
     * When the simulator elaborated a design that used a VHDL configuration
       and Verilog UDPs, it potentially leaked a large amount of memory.
     * In a mixed language simulation, SDF annotator complained about a missing
       VHDL instance, when in reality it was the VITAL generics that were
       missing from that instance.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.0d
     * vsim in some cases crashed with corrupted memory if branch code coverage
       was on and a Verilog case statement had a case alternative that was not
       a constant, such as a parameter.
     * vsim crashed when signal_force() or $signal_force() was used with the
       restart command.
     * vsim   sometimes   produced   the   error   "Internal   Error   in
       add_line_object_rec".
     * Modelsim now generates an error message if -c and -i are specified
       together on the vsim command line.
     * A GUI crash on Windows left an orphaned vlm.exe process running.
     * Using CTRL-C to break a command line simulation running on Windows
       caused a crash in some cases.
     * The WLFDeleteOnQuit modelsim.ini variable did not work.
     * In cases where a Startup command was specified in the ini file and a
       design unit was not given on the vsim command line the Startup command
       was ignored.
     * When -cover c was specified to vlog, long expressions in the Verilog
       code caused vlog to crash some cases.
     * The use of the -filemap_elab vsim switch caused the simulation to crash
       in certain situations.
     * There was a problem with vcd2wlf having to do with $scope statements
       which are hierarchical references (i.e. "top.cpu.u23").
     * A new random number generator was added for memory words more than 32
       bits wide. mem load with filltype 'random' now fills all the bits of a
       wide memory word and not just the low 32 bits.
     * The simulator failed with a malloc error when loading a design on Red
       Hat Enterprise linux release 3.
     * The vsim +delayed_timing_checks switch caused a crash due to searching
       for timing checks to move to the delayed net on the wrong nets and when
       failing to find them, returning a bad value.

   Known Defects in 6.0d
     * When  condition  coverage  is on, if-condition short-circuiting is
       disabled, all terms in the condition are evaluated.

   Product Changes to 6.0d
     * This is a clarification of the ordering of toggle nodes presented by the
       toggle report command. If you use a signal list argument wildcard, such
       as toggle report -all -r /*, the order will be the order signals are
       found when searching down the context tree using the wildcard, and
       multiple elements of the same net will be listed multiple times. If you
       do not use a wildcard, such as toggle report -all -r, the nodes will be
       listed  in the order in which they were originally added to toggle
       coverage, and there will be no duplication.
     * Toggle nodes passed to vcover through the coverage save command now use
       the top element of a multi-segment net.
     * When determining the current working directory on unix systems the PWD
       environment variable is examined to determine if it points to the same
       location. If so it's value is used. This applies to vlib, vcom, vlog,
       and vsim.

   New Features Added to 6.0d
     * The coverage save command has a new option -onexit, which when specified
       will cause the command to be executed when the simulator exits.
     * The toggle report command has a new option -onexit, which when specified
       causes the command to be executed when the simulator exits.
     * The  toggle  add  command has a new option -exclude {<list>} which
       specifies that bits of a bus be excluded from toggle computations and
       reports. <list> is a space-separated list of integers or ranges, where a
       range is two integers separated by either ":" or "-". The range must be
       in the same ascending or descending order as the signal declaration. If
       a second toggle add -exclude command is issued on the same signal, the
       latest command will override the earlier one.
     * The view and noview commands have been enhanced to handle all windows.
       They can be used to open and close these additional windows: Missed
       (missed coverage), Exclusions (coverage exclusions), Details (coverage
       details), and Instances (instance coverage). The noview command can also
       be used to close Source windows using the tab name or file name. It can
       also be used to close windows by class, for example, to close all Memory
       windows, use noview Memory. Valid classes are Source, Memory, and Wave.
     * We  have added a -unique option to the toggle report command. This
       eliminates duplicate listings for multiple ports connected to the same
       net.
     * We have added a -top option to the toggle report command. For signals
       that were added to toggle coverage using the vcom or vlog -cover t
       option, the -top option will use the name of the topmost element of
       multiple-segment  (collapsed)  nets.  Otherwise  the  name  of the
       wildcard-matching segment will be used.
     * The   vcover   report   command   has   a   new  option  -excluded
       [-user|-pragma][-do]. This will report the exclusions in the specified
       coverage database input file. It will report both user exclusions and
       source code pragma exclusions unless -user or -pragma is specified. If
       -do is specified, it will report in do-file command format.
     * The  vcover command has a new mode vcover rank which will rank the
       specified inputs according to their contribution to cumulative coverage,
       in the order specified. It does not try to change the ordering. This can
       be used with the -inputs <filename> option to place a list of files in
       file <filename>.
     * We have added a vcom -coverNoSub option to turn off code coverage in
       VHDL subprograms. Otherwise code coverage is on in VHDL subprograms.
