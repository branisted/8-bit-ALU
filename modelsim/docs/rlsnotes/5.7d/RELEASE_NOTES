   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The  following  platforms  will be discontinued as of the ModelSim
       5.8 release:
          + Redhat Linux 6.0
          + Redhat Linux 6.1
          + AIX 4.2
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.7  Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.7d  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.7d release from
       5.6x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * User-specified  preference  geometries  that  were  partial  (only
       specified  size  or  location)  or used offsets with South or East
       gravity (i.e. WxH-X-Y) were not handled correctly. These alternate
       forms of geometry specification are now supported.
     * Added  the  Verilog  2001  keywords  to  the Source window keyword
       highlighting list.
     * If you use two or more Wave windows, the add wave -window < wname>
       sig1 command now sets wname as the default Wave window.
     * Statement   coverage  reports  did  not  mark  FOR...GENERATE  and
       IF...GENERATE  (VHDL)  statements  as being executed because these
       statements  are evaluated at elaboration time. These statements no
       longer produce coverage information, and therefore don't appear as
       unexecuted in coverage reports.
     * Colorization  of  the  transcript  took  excessive  time if a line
       starting  with # ********** appeared in the transcript. Lines like
       this  can  be  generated  by  VHDL  textio or the Verilog $display
       system  task.  The  #  **  confused  the pattern matching code for
       assert messages.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * The  Verilog file I/O tasks such as $fdisplay, $fmonitor, etc. did
       not check that the file or multichannel descriptors were valid. An
       error message is now given for invalid types.
     * Removed "none" from the Verilog 2001 reserved word list.
     * The  simulator crashed when a generated instantiation was accessed
       with an out-of-range index.
     * vlog  incorrectly  required  a ";" at the end of an attribute list
       inside of an attribute statement.
     * A  continuous  assignment  having  a  value  of  type  real on the
       right-hand side produced incorrect results. Also, closely related,
       a value of type real connected to a module port produced incorrect
       results.  In  both  cases the real should have been converted to a
       32-bit integer value.
     * An  SDF  RECREM  annotation  would not annotate a lone RECOVERY or
       REMOVAL specify statement in optimized cells.
     * On  Win32,  single-stepping  over Verilog file I/O tasks sometimes
       resulted in a corrupted file handle.
     * vlog  crashed  with  an  internal  error  when  compiling a module
       instantiation within an 'else' generate statement that connected a
       literal value to a module port by name.
     * vlog  crashed  while compiling a combinational UDP with ANSI-style
       arguments  where  the  output was declared as a 'reg' (DR 341631).
       This now gives an error message rather than crashing.
     * Designs  with  both  a  parameterized  array  of  instances  and a
       generate loop crashed during elaboration.
     * The  `protect  directive  caused  vsim  to  freeze  when  a  "reg"
       declaration  was  protected  for  a  module port name that was not
       protected. The port name is now left unprotected.
     * Defparams  inside  generate-conditional  statements did not always
       propagate parameter values to lower levels in the design.
     * A  parameter  initialized  with  a  ternary  expression  having  a
       constant  selector  resulted  in  a compiler crash in some unusual
       cases.
     * A design compiled with -fast resulted in false "part-select out of
       bounds" errors in some rare cases.
     * An SDF interconnect delay from an I/O port to an I/O or input port
       in   some   cases   resulted  in  incorrect  behavior  when  using
       +multisource_int_delays.
     * Verilog  cells  containing  non-blocking  assignments and compiled
       -fast +nocheckSUDP might not have evaluated correctly.
     * A design compiled with -fast resulted in an internal error in some
       cases.
     * A  design  compiled  with  -fast  issued false "part-select out of
       bounds" error messages in some cases.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * tf_getnextlongtime()  returned  incorrect times when the time unit
       was different from the simulator time precision.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * A   VHDL  port  of  mode  out  or  inout  could  have  incorrectly
       initialized   drivers  if  the  port  did  not  have  an  explicit
       initialization  value  and the actual signal connected to the port
       had  explicit  initial  values.  Depending on a number of factors,
       ModelSim  could  incorrectly use the actual signal's initial value
       when  initializing  lowerlevel  drivers. The old pre-5.7d behavior
       can  be  matched  by  using the compiler switch -nonstddriverinit.
       Note   that  the  switch  -nonstddriverinit  does  not  cause  all
       lowerlevel  drivers  to  use the actual signal's initial value; it
       only affects the cases in which the older versions used the actual
       signal's initial value.
     * Certain null array operands of the implicit concatenation operator
       resulted in bad code being generated. This caused the simulator to
       crash.
     * The  code  coverage  feature  was  not  instrumenting VHDL package
       bodies.  Package  body  code  coverage,  however,  does not retain
       instance-specific    information.   The   statement   counts   are
       incremented  in  the  same  single buffer, no matter who calls the
       package  subprogram.  This matches the behavior of the 5.6 version
       of code coverage. Standard IEEE packages, accelerated packages and
       MTI  packages  are  automatically  excluded  from  coverage. These
       packages  include:  standard, std_logic_1164, textio, numeric_bit,
       numeric_std,           std_logic_arith,          std_logic_signed,
       std_logic_unsigned,        std_logic_textio,       std_logic_misc,
       vital_primitives, vital_timing, vital_memory, vl_types, and util.
     * Environment  variables  specified in the filename parameter to the
       std_developerskit,  std_mempak  functions,  Mem_Dump, and Mem_Load
       were not expanded.
     * Merged  processes  that  had drivers created because of subprogram
       calls  generated  bad  code  if  multiple  processes  drove  these
       signals. The bad code crashed or created only one driver.
     * If  a clocked process had a vector signal in the sensitivity list,
       in  some  cases  the  signal would be dropped from the sensitivity
       list. This resulted in incorrect simulation results.
     * Objects  declared  within a VHDL subprogram were not accessible by
       the  ModelSim examine, find, and change commands if the subprogram
       was declared within the scope of a process.
     * The step -over command sometimes incorrectly executed a process to
       the  next  wait  statement  rather  than  the next statement to be
       executed. This occurred only on HP-PA 32-bit platforms.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * mti_GetVarSubelements()  was  getting  a memory allocation failure
       when used on null arrays.
     * mti_GetParentSignal()  could cause the simulator to crash when the
       parent of a VHDL signal was an object in a Verilog module.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * Highestlevel VITAL accelerations should not have been applied to a
       level1 architecture in the presence of an inout port.
     * Parallel delay paths were not able to be annotated by an SDF file.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * The -v2k_int_delays switch caused Xs to propagate in a design if:
          + a  VHDL  design unit was instantiated within a Verilog design
            unit
          + the  VHDL  design  unit was driven by an input/inout from the
            instantiating Verilog design unit
          + the   Verilog   input/inout   was   not   annotated  with  an
            interconnect delay
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.7d
     * On x86-based architectures (Windows and Linux), the code generator
       could  use excessive stack space. If too much stack space was used
       the  simulator  would  crash  without  a  traceback. This was most
       likely to occur when elaborating a very large netlist.
     * Occasionally  the  report  generated  by  the line coverage option
       would  contain  lines  numbered  "0".  This was a result of an odd
       combination  of  overloaded  identifiers (e.g. an enum named FIRST
       and a function named "First"), used as case labels.
     * The  code  coverage  feature  did  not  differentiate branches for
       branch  coverage in case statements where multiple choices matched
       the  same  alternative. To get this functionality you must use the
       compile time option -coverBranch. This option is the same for vcom
       and vlog.
     * The  -coverage  option  was  not  saved  in  elaboration  files so
       coverage was not enabled when an elaboration file was loaded.
     * Signal Spy did not correctly recognize Verilog vectors of length 1
       ( ex. reg [0:0] vec_one; ) as vectors.
     * In  ModelSim  5.7c  the  run  -step  command was broken. Using the
       command  resulted  in  the  message  "Unknown  option -step". As a
       result of this defect the F11 function key did not work.
     * vmap  did  not  issue a warning if the -c option was used with the
       MODELSIM  environment  variable  or  if  -c  was  used and a local
       modelsim.ini  file  already  existed. The -quiet option suppresses
       these warnings.
     * If  you  received  ModelSim  error  3274, "Empty built-in function
       pointer(#)....",  later  executions  of  the vsim command may have
       caused  the  simulator  to  crash.  This  problem  only existed on
       Windows  PE,  Windows  SE,  Linux  SE,  and  RS6000 SE versions of
       ModelSim.
     * $dumpoff in the VCD file did not work correctly.
     * Running  vsim  with  the  -restore switch on Red Hat 8.0 caused an
       out-of-memory error.
     * Versions of hp700 ModelSim newer than 5.5f crashed (with a SIGILL)
       in vsim. The SIGILL occurred on HP B180 9000/778 computers running
       HPUX 11.00.
     * Certain   VHDL  clocked  processes  crashed  in  some  cases  when
       optimizations and code coverage were activated.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7d
     * DR  00106880/SC340057  - "Source Window edits are lost if a design
       is loaded".
     * DR  00107687/SC340955  -  ModelSim  would crash when attempting to
       drag  an item from the Source window to another window. This would
       occur when there were optimized VHDL components in the design, and
       the dragging was initiated from the toplevel design unit.
     * DR  00107748/SC341021  -  UM-342  include an additional note about
       coverage.
     * DR  00107617/SC340875  -  Several  DSC compliance issues have been
       resolved with postscript file generation from the Wave window.
     * DR  00107619/SC340877  -  Some  paper sizes would cause Tcl errors
       when  printing  postscript  from  the  Wave window. The first time
       printing  postscript with this patch release, be sure to go to the
       Page  Setup  screen and select the correct paper size to make sure
       all values are correct.
     * DR  00108136/SC341451  -  Concatenation  of  an  empty string with
       another string causes crash when run.
     * DR 00103325/SC336094 - ModelSim is producing errors on valid VHDL.
     * DR  00106680/SC339836  -  ModelSim  crashes with postlayout Xilinx
       simulation.
       On x86-based architectures (Windows and Linux), the code generator
       could  use excessive stack space. If too much stack space was used
       the simulator crashed without a traceback. This was most likely to
       occur when elaborating a very large netlist.
     * DR  00106706/SC339864  -  Need  to  be able to clear transcript in
       BATCH mode.
       The  command  "transcript file ?filepath?" has been added to query
       or  set  the  pathname for the transcript file. When a new file is
       specified,  the  existing  transcript  file  is  closed  and a new
       transcript  file opened. If the pathname is set to an empty string
       ("")  the  the  existing file is closed and no new file is opened.
       This   command   is   an  alias  to  the  existing  command:  "set
       PrefMain(file)" which has the same behavior.
     * DR  00106821/SC339992 - misleading message: (All branch statements
       covered).
     * DR   00107268/SC340498   -   ModelSim  rejects  valid  verilog2001
       attribute syntax.
     * DR 00122477 - Changes in state of some signals listed in a process
       sensitivity  list do not cause the process to be activated in 5.7c
       but did in 5.6x.
     * DR  00105824/SC338893  - Optimized Verilog assignments are missing
       the "arrow" in the Source window.
     * DR 00107374/SC340616 - $fdisplay is writing to STD_OUT.
     * DR  00121803 - Problem with passing parameters in Verilog generate
       clause.
     * DR 00122267 - Process merging causes ModelSim to crash.
     * DR  00108301/SC341631 - Compiler crashes when parsing ANSI C style
       ports in user-defined primitive.

   Product Changes to 5.7d
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.7d
     * The  command  "transcript file ?filepath?" has been added to query
       or  set  the  pathname for the transcript file. When a new file is
       specified,  the  existing  transcript  file  is  closed  and a new
       transcript  file opened. If the pathname is set to an empty string
       ("")  the  the  existing file is closed and no new file is opened.
       This   command   is   an  alias  to  the  existing  command:  "set
       PrefMain(file)" which has the same behavior.
     * An  option has been added to vsim to control the number of Verilog
       SDF   missing  instance  messages  that  will  be  emitted  before
       terminating  vsim.  The  option  is -sdfmaxerrors n where n is the
       maximum number of missing instance error messages to be emitted.
     * vcd  dumpports  is  now able to generate unique vcd variable names
       for  ports even if those ports are connected to the same collapsed
       net. The -unique option to vcd dumpports and the +dumpports+unique
       option to vsim activate this feature.
     * The  vlog  compiler can now be told to generate a warning whenever
       an  unknown  plus option is encountered. This functionality can be
       turned  on  by  setting  the variable Show_BadOptionWarning in the
       modelsim.ini file. This variable is set to "off" by default.
     * An  option  was  added  to  the  coverage  reload command to allow
       merging  of  coverage  statistics  from  testbenches  of different
       names.  The  option  -root  <name>  changes  the  name of the root
       testbench to the specified name for the file being reloaded.
