   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 5.8
       release.
          + For Linux:
               o Linux  is  built  on  RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1.
                 This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher.
               o RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release
                 with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60.
               o RedHat 9.0 and RedHat Enterprise Workstation 3.0 are now
                 supported (32-bit only).
               o AMD  Opteron  is  now  supported running SuSE SLES 9 (in
                 32-bit  mode  only). It is not recommended to run 32-bit
                 ModelSim on versions of SuSE earlier than 9.
               o Linux now supports large files.
          + For AIX:
               o AIX 5.2 is supported in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
               o rs64  is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1
                 and higher OS versions.
               o rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
               o rs64  will  support  large  files if you are using a JFS
                 type file system and the large file option is enabled.
               o AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8  betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating  your  Libraries"  in  the  ModelSim  Installation &
       Licensing Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.8d  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.8d release from
       5.7x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim 5.8b and
            greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features  in vlog 5.8c: the first is by using the -sv command line
       option  and  the  second is by naming the source file with a ".sv"
       suffix.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * A race condition could occur in the Wave window between the window
       being  closed  and  a value balloon popping up which resulted in a
       TCL stacktrace starting with:
       Trace back: invalid command name
       ".wave.grid.row0,wave.data"
     * The  Window->Customize  dialog box generates _add_menu commands to
       add  user  defined  buttons  to the toolbar. The command to remove
       these buttons, _del_menu, did not work.
     * There  was a WLF optimization problem characterized by sporadic or
       intermittent display of VHDL process variables in the Wave window.
     * There  was  a  WLF  optimization  problem  where  long  periods of
       inactivity  might  cause incorrect wave display after zooming out.
       For  example,  a  signal  displaying  a  long  period of 'X' might
       suddenly  appear  as a '1' after zooming out. This problem existed
       only  when  there  were  no events written to the WLF file for any
       logged signal for an extended period of simulation time.
     * vsim/vish  WLF  communication  was modified to avoid channel timed
       out waiting for response messages.
     * The  write  list  command produced different results in batch mode
       than  GUI  mode. The problem manifested itself when using a gating
       expression and the gating expression contained an event expression
       (e.g. clk'falling).
     * On  Windows,  the  action for a ".do" file type association of the
       form   C:\Modeltech_5.8b\win32\modelsim.exe  -do  "%1"  failed  to
       execute the macro file.
     * Selecting  File->Open->Format  in  the  Wave window scheduled load
       format  to  occur  after  the  current command finished instead of
       executing  load  format  immediately.  If  a  run -all command was
       issued,  a simulation break would be required to allow load format
       to finish executing.
     * When searching for a particular value in the Wave and List windows
       using  the  up/down/left/right commands the default radix was used
       to  interpret  the  value string. ModelSim now uses the radix with
       which  the  wave  or  list item is being displayed rather than the
       default radix.
     * Attempting  to  close  the  ModelSim window while a simulation was
       running  in  a non-blocking loop failed to stop the simulation and
       exit vsim.
     * The  Wave  window "Combine Signals" dialog box would accept a name
       containing  spaces,  but  would  use the name only up to the first
       space,  truncating  the  rest of the name. Names containing spaces
       are  now  reported as illegal, unless they are escaped identifiers
       (containing leading and trailing backsashes).
     * Wave  printing  failed if the zoom range was less than the current
       simulation resolution.
     * ModelSim did not read the new geometry values from modelsim.tcl.
     * In  -view mode, it was not possible to create a virtual expression
       that referenced items within a Verilog generate.
     * A  WLF  writer  problem, under rare circumstances, resulted in the
       Wave  window displaying a different value in the value column than
       that  displayed  by  the waveform at the cursor position. In those
       cases the waveform was correct.
     * Logged  VHDL  process  variables did not remain logged following a
       simulation restart.
     * The  assertion  window  was  not  fixed to the context after a run
       command when its environment was set to "fixed".
     * vsim -assertfile now works from the ModelSim prompt.
     * Double-clicking  on  a  corrupt  .wlf  file  from the Windows File
       Explorer  did  not issue any type of error message even though the
       file  was not read successfully. An error message is now issued to
       the transcript.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * No  warning  was  generated when a charge strength was given for a
       net whose type was not trireg.
     * The  mod  operator  generated  incorrect output when both operands
       were signed and less than 32 bits.
     * A  part-select of an integer variable in a port connection list of
       a  module instantiation resulted in a compiler crash if the design
       was compiled with -fast and if the module instance was inlined.
     * A  comment of the form /* */ placed inside of a `define produced a
       syntax error. For example:
       `define FOO ( 1 /* comment */ + 5 )
     * External variable references in system task or function calls made
       from within an automatic task or function caused an error.
     * Modelsim incorrectly generated the following warning:
       # ** Warning: (vsim-3007) Defparam iteration limit of 10 exceeded.
       # Region: /mixed_named_and_pos
       This  problem  was caused by having a parameter with the same name
       passed by name to an instance I1, and then to an instance I2 which
       was  an  instance  within  I1.  The  value  passed  to  I2 for the
       parameter had to be different from the value passed to I1.
     * $display()-type  tasks formatted %v strengths incorrectly when the
       design was compiled with -fast.
     * When  using $fread() with a non-zero starting index to read into a
       memory  with  a  non-zero  starting  index, the file contents were
       loaded into the wrong starting location in the memory.
     * vlog did not catch a syntax error on redeclared variables after an
       implicit wire declaration.
     * Primitives  "and", "nand", "or", "nor", "xor", and "xnor" produced
       incorrect  results if only one input was connected and if compiled
       with -fast.
     * Using   an  attribute  within  a  generate  statement  incorrectly
       produced a syntax error.
     * In  some cases the simulator crashed if a disable statement inside
       a  nested  fork inside an always block tried to disable the always
       block.
     * In  some  cases vsim crashed during simulation when a constant was
       used for a generate conditional expression.
     * In  a  design  compiled  with  -fast,  delayed  vector  continuous
       assignments  exhibited incorrect delay behavior in the case that a
       value  was  pending  while the continuous assignment was evaluated
       again to the same value.
     * A  generate loop bug fix in 5.8c introduced a significant increase
       in the elaboration time of designs that contained generate loops.
     * $fgets,  $fgetc,  and $unget system tasks now work more reasonably
       when  reading  from  stdin. When using the GUI, the input is taken
       from  the  command  window. Any prompt that has been issued with a
       $display  will  be  seen before the user has to type the requested
       input.
     * Canceled  output  pulse  events sometimes caused incorrect specify
       path selection with respect to the from edge transition.
     * Verilog designs simulated with coverage on and containing a module
       that  contained expression coverage data but no statement coverage
       data could cause a crash.
     * In  some  cases the use of +delayed_timing_checks caused incorrect
       results.
     * In  some cases annotating multi-source interconnect delays between
       optimized and non-optimized cells caused vsim to crash.
     * Port connections were not correct for an array of module instances
       when  the  design  was  compiled  with  -fast and the module being
       instantiated was optimized as a gate-level cell.
     * Using  +delayed_timing_checks  on  a  non-optimized  Verilog  cell
       caused a crash in some cases.
     * The  SystemVerilog  implicit  port  connection operator .* did not
       work correctly with -fast.
     * A  design  compiled  with  -fast  having  a  bit-select  of a port
       declared  as  a register resulted in an internal error if the port
       was  in an inlined module and if the bit-select was connected to a
       port of a module that was not inlined.
     * An  automatic  task  containing a non-simple parametric sequential
       delay  resulted  in  a  crash  during  elaboration  (for  example,
       #(2*cycle), where cycle is a parameter).
     * Some  instances  of  user-defined  system  functions used as tasks
       could cause vsim to crash.
     * A  hierarchical name containing a module name other than that of a
       top-level  module  failed  to resolve when the design was compiled
       with -fast.
     * A  misleading  error  message  was  issued  when  the  system task
       $dumpfile()  was called after the system task $dumpvars(). The new
       error  reflects  that  the  expected  order  is  to be $dumpfile()
       followed by $dumpvars().
     * The  ternary  operator  incorrectly  produced  a 'bz result if the
       condition  was  'bx  and if both operands had a value of 'bz. This
       error  occurred  only  if  the  operands  were  exactly  the  same
       expression  or  if  both  operands  were constant expressions that
       evaluated to 'bz.
     * In  some  cases  Verilog functions that met the criteria for being
       constant  functions were being compiled as constant functions even
       though they were never called in a constant expression. This could
       cause a crash during elaboration.
     * Modules  with  vectored  nets used in timing checks mignt not have
       performed properly when simulated using +notimingchecks.
     * Modules  containing  always  blocks that drive tristate primitives
       could  evaluate  incorrectly when compiled as optimized gate-level
       cells.
     * Escaped  identifiers  in  conditional  expressions for IOPATHs and
       TIMINGCHECKs caused SDF annotation errors.
     * Modules compiled with -nodebug=pli failed SDF annotation.
     * Using the same genvar in different levels of nested generate loops
       caused a crash in some cases.
     * Hierarchical  Verilog  modules  with specify paths and distributed
       delays  at  all  or some of those levels did not always choose the
       longest delay.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * VPI  functions  like vpi_put_value() could cause a simulator crash
       by  queuing  an  internal  signal  twice  when it should have been
       queued only once.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * Out-of-bounds  slices or indexes sometimes caused the simulator to
       crash.
     * vcom sometimes crashed when compiling an architecture if a Verilog
       module  with  the  same  name as the VHDL entity had been compiled
       into the work library after the VHDL entity had been compiled.
     * The  accelerated  version  of  the  Std_DevelopersKit  (std_mempak
       package)  mem_load function now correctly loads values into memory
       words  when  the word length is not a multiple of 4 (e.g., a 9-bit
       word).
     * The -lint switch for vcom will now report when the entity to which
       a  component  instantiation is bound has a port that is not on the
       component, and for which there is no error otherwise.
     * A crash during elaboration could occur if a configuration was used
       and  the  configuration specified a component configuration for an
       instantiation  that  had actuals that were vector signals declared
       in  a  package. The crash was caused by an interaction between the
       configuration  and  architecture  specified in the configuration's
       component configurations.
     * Using  the  force  command  to  set a bit in a VHDL array when the
       array  was used in the sensitivity list of merged processes caused
       the simulator to crash.
     * On  the  sunos5 platform, incorrect range check errors could occur
       on  a signal that was aliased. This occurred when the signal was a
       vector,  the  complete  signal  was aliased, and the bounds of the
       alias  were  different than that of the original signal. The alias
       bounds  were  incorrectly used when the bounds of the the original
       signal should have been used.
     * The  mem  load  command  gave an error when reading std_bit '0' in
       binary format.
     * If  there was a constant assignment to a time-valued variable that
       followed  a  WAIT  statement  which  was  sensitive  to  the  same
       variable,  the  compiler  could  erroneously  replace the original
       value of the variable with the value of the constant assignment.
     * Two  IF GENERATEs with identical direct instantiations could cause
       a  design  load  error  (crash  or  array  length mismatch) if the
       instantiations   had   no   GENERIC   MAP  and  the  entity  being
       instantiated  had  GENERICs of an array type and the GENERIC had a
       default  expression, and the first GENERATE block elaborated to no
       block  statement  because  the  condition  expression evaluated to
       FALSE, and the second GENERATE block's condition was TRUE.
     * Turning  on  coverage  of  an indexed expression whose index was a
       generic  caused erroneous simulation results. For this release, we
       will  not  do  coverage  on these kinds of expressions so that the
       simulation results are not changed.
     * Very  simple  clocked processes would cause the simulator to crash
       if the value assigned to the output was NOT(NOT( input_signal)).
     * Simulating  a  VHDL  design  with condition or expression coverage
       turned  on  for  package bodies would cause a crash. This has been
       fixed, but it requires recompiling the package bodies.
     * Using   the   "NOT"   function  for  predefined  types  like  bit,
       bit_vector,  etc.  on the actual/formal port of an instance caused
       vsim to crash.
     * The  coverage  save  command  failed to save data for VHDL package
       bodies.  The  vcover  and coverage reload commands now also handle
       package bodies.
     * An expanded name which contained a prefix which was a package with
       an empty declaration list exhibited incorrect behavior.
     * The  predefined  attributes  'HIGH  and  'LOW return the upper and
       lower  bounds,  respectively,  of  a range. The LRM definitions of
       upper  bound and lower bound in section "3.1 Scalar types" are not
       useful  if the range is a null range, and in fact are contradicted
       by  Note  1  in section "14.1 Predefined attributes". ModelSim now
       implements  this  Note,  not  the  formal definitions of upper and
       lower  bounds. The implication is that for a non-null range, there
       is  no  change  in behavior, and LOW <= HIGH as before. For a null
       range,  applying  the definition in the Note results in HIGH < LOW
       and,  in  fact, this condition can be used to determine if a range
       is null.
     * In a configuration, if two instances were bound to the same entity
       but  different  architectures, incorrect elaboration code could be
       generated. This caused a crash during elaboration.
     * A VHDL alias declared in a package did not get re-logged following
       a restart.

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * There was a problem with sc_signed and sc_unsigned where the value
       could be truncated or shifted. In some cases, debugging sc_signals
       of these types caused a crash.
     * Ports that were not assigned names via their constructors were not
       visible.  This  was  corrected  along with some other name-binding
       errors.
     * sccom  gave  an internal error when the base class and the derived
       class were not declared in the same header file.
     * sccom now accepts .cc as a valid C/C++ file extension.
     * scgenmod can now handle ports whose widths are defined in terms of
       a constant expression. For example, the following port declaration
       is now supported:
       `define SIZE 10
       input [`SIZE * 2 : 0] inp1;
     * The  default  time  unit  for  SystemC  will  be  set  to the time
       resolution  value  if  it  is  less  than the time resolution. For
       example, if the time resolution is 100ps, and the chosen time unit
       in the modelsim.ini file is ps(default), the default time unit for
       SystemC will be 100ps instead of 1ps.
     * sccom  will ignore the -o option passed on the command line with a
       warning  instead  of giving an error and exiting. Note that the -o
       option,  which  is  a  C/C++  compiler  option takes an additional
       argument  to  specify the output object filename. Hence sccom will
       also ignore the argument following the -o option.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * The  vcom  and  vlog  option  -pslfile is now supported in PE. The
       assertion CLI command is also available in PE.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * If  a  Verilog module was compiled with -93 so that the equivalent
       entity  had VHDL extended identifiers, the compiler could crash or
       the  simulator  could  fail  to  load giving a "need to recompile"
       message.   The  problem  occurred  if  VHDL  code  being  compiled
       referenced  the Verilog module name without an extended identifier
       being used as the component name.
     * A mismatch could occur if a type conversion or conversion function
       was  used  on  the  actual of an entity instantiation of a Verilog
       module.  The  resulting  type of the type conversion or conversion
       function   needed   to   be   BIT,   BIT_VECTOR,   STD_LOGIC,   or
       STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.
     * Uppercase  PORT  names  in  Verilog  instances,  with multi-source
       INTERCONNECT  delays  targeted towards a VHDL instance, caused the
       delays from the Verilog instances to be lost.
     * Only  one  driver  from  hierarchical Verilog modules, involved in
       multi-source  INTERCONNECT  delays,  driving a VHDL instance port,
       was delayed correctly. All other drivers used the default delays.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8d
     * There  was  a  restart  command  memory leak. The amount of leaked
       memory was directly proportional to the number of items logged and
       occurred during each restart.
     * Previously,  "TranscriptFile  =  xyz" was ignored the first time a
       project  file  was read. Now, each time a project file is read, if
       the  TranscriptFile  name has changed, the current transcript file
       will be closed and a file with the new name will be opened.
     * vcd2wlf  did  not  correctly  handle  escaped identifiers in scope
       statements.
     * Removed  the  lowercasing  of  Verilog names so that the output of
       vgencomp  preserves  the  case  in  the  resulting  VHDL component
       declaration.
     * Code  coverage  failed  or possibly generated incorrect results if
       the  design  contained  any  design  units compiled with -nodebug.
       Design  units  compiled  with  -nodebug  are  now  ignored,  as if
       excluded.
     * User  fileio from VHDL or Verilog was not being flushed at the end
       of  a run that occurred after a restart. Now the contents of files
       written during a run command will be viewable when the vsim prompt
       appears even after a restart.
     * In  vcd2wlf,  single-bit busses converted as a scalar instead of a
       bus with one element.
     * When  the  -above  option  to  the  coverage  report  command  was
       specified, the -below option was actually executed.
     * coverage  report -zeros was showing the hits percentage instead of
       the zeros percentage.
     * The  coverage  save -instance command failed to make the resultant
       signal   names  and  instance  paths  relative  to  the  specified
       instance. Paths are now relative.

   Known Defects in 5.8d
     * In 5.8x, if you are running with code coverage on, and have a VHDL
       entity  containing  executable  statements, and the entity is in a
       separate  file from the architecture, the coverage information for
       the  entity  will appear in the architecture file, overlaid on the
       architecture  information.  So  you  will  see bizarre things like
       coverage  data  for  comments, and multiple statement data when it
       looks like only one statement exists on a line. This will be fixed
       in 6.0.
     * SystemC  allows signals, fifos, and ports to be constructed with a
       name  passed  to  the  constructor.  That  name  is used for error
       messages.  By  default,  ModelSim  uses  that  name  as the actual
       signal,  fifo,  or port name. However, the user can mis-name these
       such  that two or more objects share the same declared or explicit
       name. Also, the user can swap names for two or more objects. These
       conflicts  are  not usually caught or resolved in ModelSim 5.8 and
       can lead to debug errors. This bug will be fixed in ModelSim 6.0.

   Product Changes to 5.8d
     * wlfrecover will now default to -force on the win32 platform.
     * To support the C Debug tool on linux_ia64, gdb 6.1 is now packaged
       with ModelSim.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8d
     * The  new modelsim.ini variable CheckPlusargs in the [vsim] section
       controls checking of plusargs on the vsim command line.
          + If unset or set to 0, vsim will ignore unrecognized plusargs.
            (default)
          + If  set  to  1,  vsim  will produce warnings for unrecognized
            plusargs,  but  will simulate while ignoring the unrecognized
            plusargs.
          + If  set  to  2,  vsim  will  produce  errors for unrecognized
            plusargs and will exit.
       Note:  The default behavior for Modelsim has always been to ignore
       unrecognized   plusargs   because   Verilog  permits  user-defined
       command-line plusargs accessible via the PLI.
     * The Wave window has a new keyboard shortcut 's' to bring into view
       and center the currently active cursor in the window.
     * The  Dataflow  window  can  now  be  used for HDL regions of mixed
       SystemC designs.
     * Off-line code coverage reporting is now available using the vcover
       utility. A variety of instance-based and package-based options are
       available.  It  currently does not support source code annotation,
       however,  because  source  code  is not saved by the coverage save
       command. Use vcover -help to see the available options.
     * The  coverage  save -instance command normally saves the specified
       instance  and  all instances below it, recursively. A -norecursive
       option has been added to limit the save to only one level.
