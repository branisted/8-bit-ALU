   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * If a virtual signal contained a constituent signal whose name contained
       brackets [...], application of the noforce command to the virtual signal
       had no effect, and returned the error message: "kernelUnknownError".
     * The user interface locked up on some platforms, including win32 and
       hp700, when multiple tab groups were used in the multiple document
       interface.
     * A File->Save operation in the Wave window saved malformed -sequence
       options  to  the command file for some cases of waves created with
       Waveform Editor commands.
     * Dataflow window symbol customization could not load a valid symbol
       description file and instead produced the error "[file] not found or not
       a valid symlib".
     * When  viewing  a Verilog design with escaped identifiers, the Show
       Selected and Hide Selected functions in the Dataflow window did not
       function correctly.
     * The Wave window crashed in certain cases when displaying the popup menu
       (RMB on a signal name) while the Wave window was actively drawing.
     * Setting the PrefMain(updateRate) preference variable to 0 caused the
       user interface to hang in an infinite loop. A value of 0 will disable
       periodic updates of the transcript during a run.
     * There was a WLF reader backwards compatibility problem when trying to
       read WLF files created with 5.3 and 5.4. In some situations the tool
       reported a corrupt WLF file when it was not.
     * An incorrect WLF logging error messages was displayed. It was similar
       to:
       INTERNAL ERROR: Illegal type to log_value: 29
       INTERNAL ERROR: Illegal signal kind to wlfiLogEvent: 2
     * The Dataflow window failed to properly load the dataflow.sym file for
       defining symbols for modules and processes.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * Converting a signed reg greater than 32-bit produced incorrect results
       if the value was negative. Most often the incorrect value was 0.0.
     * Setting a Verilog parameter with the -g or -G simulator options failed
       if the type of the target parameter depended on another parameter.
     * Using vopt on a design with non-constant indices in a hierarchical
       identifier to an instance array caused internal errors.
     * In SystemVerilog, using hierarchical references in 2/4 state mixed
       expressions resulted in memory corruption in certain cases.
     * Executing interactive vcd commands in certain cases, resulted in the
       corruption of PLI/VPI handles created during prior executions of user
       PLI code.
     * vsim did not re-elaborate the Verilog packages specified as top design
       unit on the command line when the simulator was restarted.
     * In certain cases, vopt elaborated a Verilog package specified as a top
       design unit twice. In this case, if the package contains bind statements
       (root scope packages can contain bind), they were executed more than
       once.
     * A problem in the handling of the -y option in vlog resulted in slight
       corruptions in the resulting libraries. These corruptions did not result
       in any functional differences during simulation, but resulted in invalid
       syntax errors reported when the libraries were refreshed or when a
       design was optimized. If you use the -refresh option to update libraries
       and encounter errors, you will need to rebuild the libraries from the
       original source. If no error is encountered, the library will operate
       correctly.
     * The SDF reader did not accept a TIMESCALE of 10fs in SDF files. (1fs and
       100fs were ok).
     * When  annotating  compiled  SDF  files with +sdf_verbose the 'Cell
       instances' count was reported as 0. As a result of the SDF compilation
       process,  the notion of SDF cells is not preserved and will not be
       reported. The other annotated objects such as Module Paths, Timing
       Checks and MIPDs are still reported. Since these latter objects are the
       ones  that are truely annotated the +sdf_verbose option will still
       provide a quick check to verify if the annotation was successful. For
       detailed debugging purposes please use the write timing command.
     * In SystemVerilog a comparison of hierarchical references to real types
       failed with the error "Comparison of these types not supported".
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * The acc_handle_condition call should return NULL when the path is not
       conditional.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * A concurrent signal assigment statement appearing immediately within an
       architecture  statement  part  and having a waveform element value
       expression  containing  a type conversion whose target type was an
       unconstrained array type and whose operand was of a non-locally static
       constrained array subtype (or could be determined to have non-locally
       static index range(s)) caused a memory leak in certain cases.
     * When doing synthesis checks the compiler incorrectly reported a VITAL
       error when a signal was read within a variable assignment and not in the
       sensitivity list.
     * In a clocked process, if there are assignments of the form
       output <= TYPE_CONVERSION'(input);
       Then the code generated by the default optimization level caused the
       simulator to crash in certain cases.
     * The warning message "Recursive call to function" from vcom with -lint
       option can be suppressed now.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * If the -vital_fix_negative_setup_hold_sum switch was specified on the
       simulator  command-line,  the  simulator  issued  a warning during
       elaboration, if the sum of setup and hold times for a data/reference
       signal combination was negative. Now, the negative setup or hold time
       will be set to zero before the negative constraint calculation phase
       prescribed in Section 8.2.2.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * There was an undefined symbol reference error on Solaris when a class
       was derived from sc_signal_resolved.
     * The value of a SystemC fixed-point signal was not set correctly at the
       mixed-language boundary.
     * The value for a sc_signal_resolved channel was incorrect if it was
       driven from multiple SystemC processes and a Verilog or VHDL inout port.
     * Values driven to a sc_int SystemC signal from VHDL or Verilog were not
       getting sign extended.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.1e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1e
     * vmake generated makefiles where a source file name appeared more than
       once in the same dependency list.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.1e
     * dts0100317673 - Opening a .wlf file in ModelsimPE will cause a "#-new
       not supported on PE" error.
     * dts0100315885 - Wrong name for window "wave preferences".
     * dts0100315637 - Global optimization in RTL is causing simulator to
       crash.
     * dts0100320165 - Vopt fails on testbench with SV assertions.
     * dts0100313876 - vlog crash for automatic variable in hierarchical path
       index.
     * dts0100313566 - Error: bad window path name ".main_pane.cs.14".
     * dts0100315451 - The simulator hangs due to bad .modelsim file.
     * dts0100312079 - Want ability to turn off "recursive call to function"
       warning.
     * dts0100319810 - Dataflow Symbol customization issue.
     * dts0100305195  -  Compiled  sdf  reports  a  cell  count of 0 with
       +sdf_verbose.
     * dts0100267040 - GUI hangs when PrefMain(updateRate) is set to 0 and
       documentation is incorrect on the functionality of this variable.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.1e
     * When running in vopt mode with code coverage on for designs that contain
       parameterized modules or entities, where the parameter changes the
       structure of the design unit, there are some known problems. Reports
       generated by design unit will generate a report for each alternative
       structure of the design unit, but they will all use the same design unit
       name. Secondly, reports generated by file will have incorrect statistics
       for the file containing the parameterized design unit.
     * "quit -f" sometimes will crash gdb.exe on windows platform when Cdebug
       is turned on and "cdbg quit" has not been issued. The workaround is to
       quit the C debugger first by "cdbg quit", and then issue "quit -f".
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.1e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1e
     * vmake -ignore omits a make rule for the named primary design unit and
       it's secondary design units. vmake -f specifies a file to read command
       line arguments from. Note: Previous versions allowed an abbreviated form
       of -fullsrcpath to be given as -f.
     * Added a -coverGenerate option to vcom and vlog to turn on code coverage
       inside the top level of generate blocks. Also added a CoverGenerate
       variable to the modelsim.ini file. Code coverage is already on inside of
       instances within generate blocks, but code at the top level normally has
       code coverage turned off to keep ungenerated blocks from standing in the
       way  of  100% code coverage. Further improvements in code coverage
       handling of generate blocks are in the works.
     * Added a -coverExcludeDefault option to vcom and vlog to automatically
       exclude code coverage from the default branch of case statements. Also
       added a CoverExcludeDefault variable to the modelsim.ini file.
