   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.5 Betas or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Listed below are platform support changes starting with the next
       major ModelSim release, version 5.6:
          + The Windows 95 platform will no longer be supported.
          + The executables in .../modeltech/hp700 will be based on HPUX
            11.0. If you need HPUX 10.20 compatible executables, they
            will be in a new platform directory .../modeltech/hp700_1020.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
       .PDF files contained in ModelSim versions 5.5c or greater.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 10.2, 11
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * The drivers command sometimes resulted in an error message: "#
       unmatched open brace in list."
     * Wave Window bookmarks with names containing spaces did not work
       correctly.
     * The Coverage Summary Window was not correctly reading the saved
       preference file to set the window geometry.
     * If the List Window had a gate expression defined, and signals in
       the expression were not logged, evaluation of the expression
       resulted in the error: "Error in do_list_scan". All signals in the
       gate expression will now be logged automatically.
     * Using the Up and Down arrow keys while the simulator was executing
       another command would cause previous commands to appear
       incorrectly formatted in the Transcript Window. These keys are now
       disabled until the current command completes execution.
     * A Virtual signal constructed as a concatenation of bits of Verilog
       registers would incorrectly show "false" transitions in the Wave
       Window. More specifically, it showed transitions when bits that
       were not selected as part of the virtual signal changed in the
       original registers.
     * Gate expressions in the List Window resulted in extra lines in the
       List Window/file if signal triggers were disabled. The correct
       behavior for a gate expression is to filter a prospective list
       line.
     * The List Window -gateexpr configuration was not independent of the
       -usegating flag. The gate expression was ignored unless the
       -usegating flag was already set.
     * Certain Wave Window menus did not enable when a multiple selection
       was made and the top item in the section was a divider. The
       following menus did not enable properly: Format->Radix,
       Format->Format, and the name column popup menu selections Radix
       and Format.
     * The default logical name assigned to a WLF file was not always a
       legal dataset name. Legal characters are all alphanumerics and
       '_'. All others are changed to '_' in the default logical name.
     * Parsing was incorrect for dataset names in slices where no dataset
       was specified. For example: a(1:2) This example produced an error
       thinking the dataset name was "a(1".
     * Attempting to open the Expression Builder dialog while it was
       already open caused a TCL error.
     * The -label option to the compare add command was not working.
     * There was a problem with comparing Verilog registers against VHDL
       std_logic_vectors in which the type conversion failed to work
       properly and the compare run command caused vsim to crash.
     * The Library import wizard incorrectly reported that the std and
       ieee libraries were not mapped. The problem was due to not
       expanding environment variables when the library mappings were
       looked up in the modelsim.ini file. For example,
       $MODEL_TECH/../std.
     * "Insert Selected Signal" did not work correctly in the expression
       builder associated with selected signals in the list window.
     * The "Signal Name(s)" field in the Wave/List Window search dialog
       now correctly shows the list of signals.
     * Double-clicking in the value column of the Wave Window did not
       bring up the Wave Signal Properties dialog if the double click
       followed the action of expanding a composite signal.
     * Transcript colorization now uses the values of
       PrefMain(noteColor), PrefMain(warningColor), PrefMain(errorColor),
       and PrefMain(failureColor) to colorize VHDL assertion messages. To
       be effective, PrefMain(colorizeTranscript) needs to be set to 1.
       By default, this variable is set to 0.
     * The -reportprogress compiler switch did not work correctly in
       batch mode. It reported the error:
       bgerror failed to handle background error.
       Original error: can't read "c": no such variable
       Error in bgerror: invalid command name "bgerror"
     * Parent signals that were virtual signal concatenations did not
       reflect the "no data" status of their composite elements.
     * Window->Iconify All sometimes produced the error:
       "Error: can't iconify '.examPopUp': override-redirect flag is
       set."
     * The Wave Window incorrectly scrolled to the end of simulation time
       after the radix command was entered on the command line.
     * The UI was leaking 256k with each restart or simulation load.
     * Small amounts of memory were leaked with each ModelSim specific
       Tcl command (e.g. force, run) executed. This was a PE only
       problem.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * If an inlined module compiled with -fast no longer existed in the
       library when the design was loaded, the simulator issued an error
       message and crashed.
     * When compiling verilog source files with the -compile_uselib
       switch, some lower level modules were not compiled. This caused
       the following simulator error message during elaboration:
       ERROR: ./mylib/mod.v(10): Instantiation of 'amod' failed (design
       unit not found).
     * SDF annotation was very slow for path delays having bit-selects or
       part-selects on the input side of the path delay if those inputs
       had also been annotated with a prior interconnect delay.
     * The +transport_path_delays option selected the wrong output edge
       dependent delay when there were multiple pending output events.
     * The simulator crashed on HP and Sun platforms if a module
       contained a large expression, or an expression with large
       operands, or a large number of functions. The crash occurred if
       the temporaries required for expression evaluation exceeded 32k.
     * Concatenation of a single integer variable incorrectly produced a
       signed result.
     * A crash occurred sometimes if multiple restarts were issued and
       the design contained inlined Verilog modules.
     * The compiler issued a false error message if the delayed nets in
       the $setuphold timing check (for negative constraints) were
       declared as scalars and the associated ports in the timing check
       were bit-selects of vector ports.
     * A particular pattern of selectors in casex and casez statements
       caused the compiler to consume too many resources during
       optimization. The pattern was of the form:
       casex (v)
       4'b1xxx: ...
       4'bx1xx: ...
       4'bxx1x: ...
       4'bxxx1: ...
       endcase
     * 32-bit versus 64-bit ModelSim versions could produce different
       results. The problem was reported in a Verilog model of a shift
       register with a shifting pattern of 20 bits.
     * During Vsim's native code generation if the internal code buffer
       becomes full as a case statement jump table is being built, bad
       branch addresses may result causing the branches of some case
       statements to jump to a bad address. This problem can be
       intermittent.
     * An out-of-bounds bit-select crashed the simulator for some vectors
       having a width greater than 32 bits.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * vpi_get_value() will now generate an error if the value of a
       vpiStringConst object is requested with a format other than
       vpiStringVal, vpiVectorVal, or vpiObjTypeVal. This correction
       brings vpi_get_value() up to date with the 2000 version of the
       IEEE standard.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * A crash could have resulted if an ASSERT condition contained an
       expression involving a function or operator from package
       std_logic_arith, and the REPORT expression also involved such a
       function or operator, and the ASSERT was TRUE (i.e., the REPORT
       was not executed).
     * A foreign subprogram declared in an entity caused a fatal error
       during simulation startup.
     * Static range expressions occurring in recursively defined entities
       configured within configuration declarations caused the compiler
       to enter a non-terminating loop. The compiler has been changed to
       record when static ranges have been initialized during code
       generation for configurations.
     * Added VHDL 93 level support for the alias declaration syntax.
       Previously ModelSim only had VHDL 87 level support for alias
       declarations. The difference is that the subtype_indication is
       optional in VHDL 93 where it was required in VHDL 87.
     * Vector expression connected to ports would cause invalid size
       mismatches errors. If the expression is more complicated than a
       simple name, tempory value were generated and incorrectly
       overwritten.
     * When using default binds, a crash or an incorrect size mismatch
       error would be generated in the following case: The type of a port
       is dependent on a generic, the generic is mapped to an expression
       that contains higher level generics.
     * In some cases, non-static aggregates were associated with
       subelements of ports, which was a violation of the IEEE standard.
       The current correct behavior is:
       When no switches are used this situation results in an error.
       When the -pedanticerrors switch is used the warning is upgraded to
       an error.
       When the switch -nononstaticportaggrerror is used neither a
       warning nor an error are produced.
     * When at least one of subelement of a port is associated with a
       signal, and another subelement of the same port is associated with
       an aggregate containing an OTHERS choice, the compiler would
       terminate with an assertion error message containing the text:
       "!(have_others && needSignal)"
       This assertion error has been removed.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * mti_ForceSignal and mti_ReleaseSignal failed to work when the path
       separator was set to a "." instead of a "/".
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * Negative interconnect delays from SDF files were annotated onto
       interconnect delay generics. Validation is now performed on
       interconnect delays read from SDF files. When negative, the
       associated delay generics are set to zero. Similar to the way such
       errors are handled in Verilog, no warnings or errors will be
       reported when this replacement occurs.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * The assignment of 1'b0 to a net in a Verilog module three levels
       deep in the hierarchy did not propagate all the way to the top.
       The instance hierarchy had a Verilog top level which contained a
       VHDL instance which contained the Verilog module instance where
       the assignment was done. (If all the instances down the hierarchy
       were Verilog, then there was no problem.)
     * On 32-bit platforms that could handle files greater than 2GB, SDF
       files greater than this limit caused "File not found." errors.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.5d
     * Executing vmake with a library pathname argument (not "work") when
       some design units in that library had been compiled with no
       compiler options caused vmake to crash.
     * To prevent circular chains of library mappings (e.g., logical
       library lib1 is mapped to logical library lib2, which is mapped to
       lib1), checks have been incorporated into the compilers and
       simulators to check that logical libraries are not mapped to other
       logical libraries. When circular chains of library mapping are
       present the following warning will be issued:
       WARNING: Logical library 'lib1' is mapped to logical library
       'lib2'. Logical libraries should be mapped to directory paths.
     * The sequence, cold restore, checkpoint, warm restore, checkpoint
       caused a memory management error.
     * The -noaccel option of vcom had mistakenly been disabled. This was
       a ModelSim PE issue only.
     * When executing the library refresh command via the popup menu in
       the workspace pane, the design unit argument was not correctly
       passed to the compiler.
     * Command line generics specified with -g or -G were not parsed
       correctly if they contained extended identifiers that contained
       the path separator character. For example,
       -g/top/\\u1/u2/u3\\/myGeneric=7.
     * There was a restart problem with designs invoked with multiple -G
       generic command line arguments when the generic names were the
       same.
     * Spaces in filenames are now supported in the Coverage Window.
     * The VHDL command init_signal_spy and the system task
       $init_signal_spy now correctly report that the spying of Verilog
       Memories is not supported.
     * The following sequence: open file A, read part of file A,
       checkpoint, close file A, and finally open file A, opened file A
       at the location where the checkpoint occurred. It now will open
       file A at the start of file A.
     * The mgls.dll did not recognize the T-Guard dongles. This was a
       Windows and Altera OEM problem only.
     * ModelSim crashed with a restart command or when vsim was
       subinvoked and the design contained virtual signals, functions,
       expressions, or slices (implicit virtuals).

   Known Defects in 5.5d
     * When the Source Window is brought up the first time, the source
       colorization and highlighting of executable lines will not change
       dynamically but remain constant.
       For the case where there is an existing Source Window, and you do
       a File > Open, and pick a file which has source lines that just
       fit the Source Window, the same non-changeable colorization and
       highlighting occurs.
     * When multiple variables are selected in the Source Window, the
       variable balloon (via Right Mouse Button) displays the same
       variable even when the cursor is moved from one variable to the
       next.
     * Selected text in the Source Window or Transcript Window gets
       unhighlighted when the cursor moves out of the window or to the
       toolbar or menu bar. This is a Windows only issue.
     * Using the menu sequence Design > Create a New Library to create a
       new library and mapping when a library already existed causes a
       window system error message to appear via a dialog box.
     * Executing the vmap command at the VSIM prompt does not update the
       Library drop-down list.
     * When single-stepping in a .coverage_source Window, as long as the
       context stays within the current file the coverage numbers can be
       seen to increment with each step. If a step causes another source
       file to be brought up, then the coverage numbers in the first
       column do not increment correctly. Sometimes clicking on the name
       of the current source file in the Coverage_Summary Window will
       correct the problem.
     * Start a compare, and do some compare runs. If a compare reload
       command is unsuccessful, ModelSim does an implicit compare end
       without providing an option to save results and the data is lost.
     * When ModelSim is invoked with "vsim -lib vhwork", the library
       entry in the Design tab of the Load Design dialog box incorrectly
       shows the default library "work" instead of the specified library
       "vhwork".
     * Loading a Tcl shared library fails on rs64 with the following
       message: ERROR: couldn't load file " testload.sl": readExports:
       bad magic number
     * List Window Marker problems:
          + If you add a bunch of signals to the List Window then select
            Markers > Add Marker with nothing selected in the List
            Window, then the 2nd list line is highlighted. If you then
            click on another line then no marker outline is left on the
            supposedly added marker line.
          + If you click on some line and do Markers > Add Marker then
            the line selected is marked with an outline but the second
            list line is highlighted.
          + With a marker added on a particular line, if you then click
            on various lines in the List Window then the marker outline
            occasionally moves to some other line (usually the previously
            selected line). Markers don't stay put.
     * List Window scrolling problems:
          + When using the Find dialog box to find signals, when the next
            signal is outside of what is currently showing in the List
            Window, the window is not scrolled to show the next item
            found.
          + If you do a find to the left and the search goes past the
            beginning of the list to wrap around to the end of the list
            and there's a lot of stuff in the list window that is out of
            view, then the List Window scrolls right only one page even
            though that does not bring the next selected item into view.
          + When doing a search forward on an item's values, the next
            line to match is scrolled to the top line but the scroll bar
            stays the full length of the scroll bar region. (This is in a
            List Window where there aren't very many lines of data.)
          + The documentation for the List Window says that the up and
            down arrow keys are supposed to move the line selection up or
            down one line. The current behavior is that the up and down
            arrow keys behave exactly the same as the TAB and shift-TAB
            keys (searches for next transition).
     * In some cases, Redhat 6.0 did not have coverage for the entire
       source file. There is no problem with Redhat 6.1, 6.2 and 7.0.
     * In the Library page of the main window workspace, if a design unit
       is selected and accessed with a right button click to Edit or
       Refresh or Recompile, the following error will occur:
       Error - cannot read work/_info: No such file or directory
       This bogus error message occurs only when the Library entry field
       in the Library page is set to work, and work is logically mapped
       to another library directory name.
       The work around is to set the Library entry field to the actual
       library name instead of work.
     * A virtual signal foo is defined. The checkpoint command is issued.
       Then, virtual count gives a count of 0. It should be 1. Nothing is
       saved during virtual save command. The virtual count and virtual
       save commands before the checkpoint give the correct expected
       results. Also virtual show and virtual describe foo after the
       checkpoint give the correct expected results. virtual count
       andvirtual save are not working correctly. This bug also exists in
       5.4e
     * There is an inconsistency in how the path separator works when
       parsing commands. Given that the path separator in the example
       below is "/ ", .top.clk should not work.
       echo $PathSeparator
       # /
       exa /top/clk
       # 1
       exa /clk
       # 1
       exa clk
       # 1
       exa .top.clk
       # 1
       exa .clk
       # evaluating expression ".clk"
       # No object found matching clk in context /
       # Item '.clk' not found
     * The following steps show a waveform compare problem.
          + In the compare wizard, specify an opened dataset and a sim
            dataset to be compared (via the compare start functionality).
          + Log some simulation signals.
          + The button "Update after simulation run" should NOT be
            checked.
          + Click the "Compute Diffs Now" button in the wizard. This
            message was given: "Null time range for signal compare". The
            message could be improved to "Cannot compare run because no
            simulation data currently available"
          + Do a run 500.
          + Do a compare info command. The following message is given:
            "No comparison differences" Does it mean my comparisons were
            all matches? A better message choice might be "No available
            compare data, please do a compare run or compare update
            first.".
       A compare run or compare update had not been done, so there should
       be no compare results or data. The Wave Window is correct at this
       point; the compare signal does not show any compare result.
     * No waves are displayed in the Wave Window for virtual constants or
       virtual functions that are children of virtuals.
     * Virtual signals which are a concatenation of a signal from a view
       dataset and a sim dataset show "-No Data-" in the Signals Window,
       even after simulation.
     * A virtual signal containing a Verilog bit was expanded within a
       Signals Window. Double clicking on this Verilog bit to invoke a
       view declaration did not bring up the Source Window. If the
       Source Window was already opened, it did not highlight this
       signal.

   Product Changes to 5.5d
     * Waveform Examine Popup Changes
         1. The new preference variable, PrefWave(WaveformPopupEnabled),
            is used to enable/disable this popup specifically.
         2. The value is now saved in the modelsim.tcl file when GUI
            preferences get saved (Main Window, Options->Save
            Preferences).
         3. The "Tooltip Examine" in the wave popup menu has been removed
            and the setting is now available on the Wave Window Display
            Properties dialog as Waveform Popup Enabled. (Wave Window,
            Edit->Display Properties).
     * Project View changes.
          + The compile order dialog box was replaced with in-place drag
            and drop.
          + The Project Window now has detection for "out-of-date"
            compiles.
     * Added a stronger compiler warning about not using OPEN on an
       actual individual element of an array formal port when using the
       1987 standard. This is illegal in the 1993 standard and was
       revised to be illegal in the 1987 standard by the ISAC committee.
       However, due to customer complaints about existing designs no
       longer working, we relaxed this to be a warning. Customers should
       be aware that that there are usages of this construct that will
       cause design elaboration crashes, and these are not considered a
       bug. This is the reason for the much stronger warning.

   New Features Added to 5.5d
     * Added support for code coverage and profiling for ModelSim PE.
       ModelSim PE requires the same licensing features as ModelSim SE to
       enable the functionality.
     * A new vsim switch, -vcdstim, has been added which is similar to
       the -vcdread switch except that the -vcdstim switch allows an
       extended VCD file to be read in as stimulus.
     * Project View enhancements.
          + Added "out-of-date" compile detection in the project window.
          + Improved the performance of the project write procedures.
          + Replaced the compile order dialog box with in-place drag and
            drop.
     * New vsim switches were added to extend the violation regions of
       $setuphold and $recrem timing checks before zeroing. Without these
       switches, during analysis of delay net delays, if it is determined
       that a solution of delays can not be determined for a given set of
       timing checks the smallest negative setup/recovery limit is zeroed
       and the analysis is repeated. If no negative setup/recovery limits
       exist, then the smallest negative hold/removal limit is zeroed.
       The analysis and limit zeroing is repeated until a solution is
       determined.
       Use of either
          + -extend_tcheck_data_limit <max_percent_of_limit_relaxation>
          + -extend_tcheck_ref_limit <max_percent_of_limit_relaxation>
       causes a one time extension of qualifying limits in an attempt to
       provide a delay net delay solution prior to any limit zeroing. A
       limit qualifies if it bounds a violation region which does not
       overlap a related violation region. For example,
       $setuphold( posedge clk, posedge d, 45, 70, notifier,,,dclk,dd);
       $setuphold( posedge clk, negedge d, 216, -68, notifier,,,dclk,dd);
       are the same check type and have the same delay nets and thus are
       related. The delay net delay analysis in this case does not
       provide a solution as the required delay between d and dd of 68
       for the negative hold could cause a non-violating posedge d
       transition to be delayed on dd so that it could arrive after dclk
       for functional evaluation. By default the -68 hold limit is set
       pessimistically to 0 to insure the correct functional evaluation.
       The other option is to use -extend_tcheck_data_limit to change the
       data limit of -68 to 44 (a 21 percent adjustment) or
       -extend_tcheck_ref_limit to change the reference limit of 45 to
       69 (a 16 percent adjustment).
