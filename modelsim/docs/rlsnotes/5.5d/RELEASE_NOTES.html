<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
 You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
 5.5 Betas or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries" in
 the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
</li>
<li>
Listed below are platform support changes starting with the next major ModelSim release, version 5.6:
<ul>
<li>The Windows 95 platform will no longer be supported.
<li>The executables in .../modeltech/hp700 will be based on HPUX 11.0. If you need
HPUX 10.20 compatible executables, they will be in a new platform directory
.../modeltech/hp700_1020.
</ul>


</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .PDF files 
contained in ModelSim versions 5.5c or greater.
</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 10.2, 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>drivers</b> command sometimes resulted in an error message:
"# unmatched open brace in list."

</li>
<li>
Wave Window bookmarks with names containing spaces did not work correctly.
</li>
<li>
The Coverage Summary Window was not correctly reading the saved preference 
file to set the window geometry.
</li>
<li>
If the List Window had a gate expression defined, and signals in the
expression were not logged, evaluation of the expression resulted in the error:
"Error in do_list_scan". All signals in the gate expression will now be logged
automatically.

</li>
<li>
Using the Up and Down arrow keys while the simulator was executing another
command would cause previous commands to appear incorrectly formatted in the
Transcript Window. These keys are now disabled until the current command 
completes execution.
</li>
<li>
A Virtual signal constructed as a concatenation of bits of Verilog registers 
would incorrectly show "false" transitions in the Wave Window. More 
specifically, it showed transitions when bits that were not selected as part 
of the virtual signal changed in the original registers.
</li>
<li>
Gate expressions in the List Window resulted in extra lines in the
List Window/file if signal triggers were disabled.  The correct behavior
for a gate expression is to filter a prospective list line.
</li>
<li>
The List Window <b>-gateexpr</b> configuration was not independent of
the <b>-usegating</b> flag. The gate expression was ignored unless the
<b>-usegating</b> flag was already set.
</li>
<li>
Certain Wave Window menus did not enable when a multiple selection was
made and the top item in the section was a divider. The following
menus did not enable properly: <b>Format->Radix</b>, <b>Format->Format</b>, 
and the name column popup menu selections Radix and Format.
</li>
<li>
The default logical name assigned to a WLF file was not always a 
legal dataset name.  Legal characters are all alphanumerics and '_'.
All others are changed to '_' in the default logical name.
</li>
<li>
Parsing was incorrect for dataset names in slices where no dataset was specified.
For example: a(1:2)  This example produced an error thinking the dataset
name was "a(1". 
</li>
<li>
Attempting to open the Expression Builder dialog while it was already
open caused a TCL error.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-label</b> option to the <b>compare add</b> command was not working.
</li>
<li>
There was a problem with comparing Verilog registers against VHDL
std_logic_vectors in which the type conversion failed to work
properly and the <b>compare run</b> command caused <b>vsim</b> to crash.
</li>
<li>
The Library import wizard incorrectly reported that the std and ieee libraries 
were not mapped.  The problem was due to not expanding environment variables
when the library mappings were looked up in the modelsim.ini file. For example,
$MODEL_TECH/../std.
</li>
<li>
"Insert Selected Signal" did not work correctly in the expression builder
associated with selected signals in the list window.
</li>
<li>
The "Signal Name(s)" field in the Wave/List Window search dialog now
correctly shows the list of signals.
</li>
<li>
Double-clicking in the value column of the Wave Window did not
bring up the Wave Signal Properties dialog if the double click followed the 
action of expanding a composite signal.
</li>
<li>
Transcript colorization now uses the values of PrefMain(noteColor),
PrefMain(warningColor), PrefMain(errorColor), and PrefMain(failureColor) to
colorize VHDL assertion messages. To be effective, PrefMain(colorizeTranscript)
needs to be set to 1. By default, this variable is set to 0.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-reportprogress</b> compiler switch did not work correctly
in batch mode.  It reported the error:<br>
  bgerror failed to handle background error.<br>
      Original error: can't read "c": no such variable<br>
      Error in bgerror: invalid command name "bgerror"
</li>
<li>
Parent signals that were virtual signal concatenations did not reflect the 
"no data" status of their composite elements.
</li>
<li>
<b>Window->Iconify All</b> sometimes produced the error:<br>
"Error: can't iconify '.examPopUp': override-redirect flag is set."
</li>
<li>
The Wave Window incorrectly scrolled to the end of simulation time 
after the <b>radix</b> command was entered on the command line.
</li>
<li>
The UI was leaking 256k with each restart or simulation load.
</li>
<li>
Small amounts of memory were leaked with each ModelSim specific Tcl command 
(e.g. force, run) executed. This was a PE only problem.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
If an inlined module compiled with <b>-fast</b> no longer existed in the 
library when the design was loaded, the simulator issued an error message
and crashed.
</li>
<li>
When compiling verilog source files with the <b>-compile_uselib </b>
switch, some lower level modules were not compiled. This 
caused the following simulator error message during elaboration:
<p>
<code>
 ERROR: ./mylib/mod.v(10): Instantiation of 'amod' failed (design unit not found).
</code>


</li>
<li>
SDF annotation was very slow for path delays having bit-selects or part-selects
on the input side of the path delay if those inputs had also been annotated
with a prior interconnect delay.

</li>
<li>
The <b>+transport_path_delays</b> option selected the wrong output edge 
dependent delay when there were multiple pending output events.

</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed on HP and Sun platforms if a module contained a
large expression, or an expression with large operands, or a large number
of functions. The crash occurred if the temporaries required for expression
evaluation exceeded 32k.

</li>
<li>
Concatenation of a single integer variable incorrectly produced a signed
result.

</li>
<li>
A crash occurred sometimes if multiple restarts were issued and the design
contained inlined Verilog modules.

</li>
<li>
The compiler issued a false error message if the delayed nets in the
$setuphold timing check (for negative constraints) were declared as
scalars and the associated ports in the timing check were bit-selects
of vector ports.

</li>
<li>
A particular pattern of selectors in casex and casez statements caused the
compiler to consume too many resources during optimization. The pattern was
of the form:<br>
<code>
casex (v)<br>
4'b1xxx: ...<br>
4'bx1xx: ...<br>
4'bxx1x: ...<br>
4'bxxx1: ...<br>
endcase<br>
</code>

</li>
<li>
32-bit versus 64-bit ModelSim versions could produce different results. The problem was reported in a Verilog model of a shift register with a shifting pattern of 20 bits.


</li>
<li>
During Vsim's native code generation if the internal code buffer
becomes full as a case statement jump table is being built,  bad
branch addresses may result causing the branches of some case
statements to jump to a bad address. This problem can be intermittent.
</li>
<li>
An out-of-bounds bit-select crashed the simulator for some vectors
having a width greater than 32 bits.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
vpi_get_value() will now generate an error if the value of a vpiStringConst
object is requested with a format other than vpiStringVal, vpiVectorVal, or
vpiObjTypeVal. This correction brings vpi_get_value() up to date with the 
2000 version of the IEEE standard.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
A crash could have resulted if an ASSERT condition contained an expression 
involving a function or operator from package std_logic_arith, and the REPORT 
expression also involved such a function or operator, and the ASSERT was TRUE
(i.e., the REPORT was not executed).
</li>
<li>
A foreign subprogram declared in an entity caused a fatal error during
simulation startup.

</li>
<li>
Static range expressions occurring in recursively defined entities configured
within configuration declarations caused the compiler to enter a non-terminating
loop. The compiler has been changed to record when static ranges have been
initialized during code generation for configurations.
</li>
<li>
Added VHDL 93 level support for the alias declaration syntax.
Previously ModelSim only had VHDL 87 level support for
alias declarations. The difference is that the subtype_indication
is optional in VHDL  93 where it was required in VHDL 87.

</li>
<li>
Vector expression connected to ports would cause invalid size mismatches errors.
If the expression is more complicated than a simple name, tempory value were
generated and incorrectly overwritten.
</li>
<li>
When using default binds, a crash or an incorrect size mismatch error would
be generated in the following case: The type of a port is dependent on a
generic, the generic is mapped to an expression that contains higher level
generics.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, non-static aggregates were associated with subelements of ports, 
which was a violation of the IEEE standard. The current correct behavior is:<br>
When no switches are used this situation results in an error.<br>
When the <b>-pedanticerrors</b> switch is used the warning is upgraded to an 
error.<br>
When the switch <b>-nononstaticportaggrerror</b> is used neither a warning nor 
an error are produced.
</li>
<li>
When at least one of subelement of a port is associated with a signal, 
and another subelement of the same port is associated with an aggregate 
containing an OTHERS choice, the compiler would terminate with an 
assertion error message containing the text:<BR>
"!(have_others && needSignal)"<BR>
This assertion error has been removed.
</li>
</ul>

mti_ForceSignal and mti_ReleaseSignal failed to work when the path
separator was set to a "." instead of a "/".

<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>

<li>
Negative interconnect delays from SDF files were annotated onto interconnect
delay generics. Validation is now performed on interconnect delays read from
SDF files. When negative, the associated delay generics are set to zero.
Similar to the way such errors are handled in Verilog, no warnings or errors
will be reported when this replacement occurs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The assignment of 1'b0 to a net in a Verilog module three levels deep in the
hierarchy did not propagate all the way to the top. The instance hierarchy
had a Verilog top level which contained a VHDL instance which contained the
Verilog module instance where the assignment was done. (If all the instances
down the hierarchy were Verilog, then there was no problem.)
</li>
<li>
On 32-bit platforms that could handle files greater than 2GB, SDF files 
greater than this limit caused "File not found." errors.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Executing <b>vmake</b> with a library pathname argument (not "work") when
some design units in that library had been compiled with no compiler
options caused <b>vmake</b> to crash.
</li>
<li>
To prevent circular chains of library mappings (e.g., logical library lib1
is mapped to logical library lib2, which is mapped to lib1), checks have been
incorporated into the compilers and simulators to check that logical libraries
are not mapped to other logical libraries. When circular chains of library 
mapping are present the following warning will be issued:<br>
<code>
WARNING: Logical library 'lib1' is mapped to logical library 'lib2'. Logical
libraries should be mapped to directory paths.
</code>

</li>
<li>
The sequence, cold <b>restore</b>, <b>checkpoint</b>, warm <b>restore</b>, 
<b>checkpoint</b> caused a memory management error.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-noaccel</b> option of <b>vcom</b> had mistakenly been disabled.
This was a ModelSim PE issue only.

</li>
<li>
When executing the <b>library refresh</b> command via the popup menu in the
workspace pane, the design unit argument was not correctly passed to the
compiler.  
</li>
<li>
Command line generics specified with <b>-g</b> or <b>-G</b> were not parsed 
correctly if they contained extended identifiers that contained the path 
separator character. For example, -g/top/\\u1/u2/u3\\/myGeneric=7.
</li>
<li>
There was a <b>restart</b> problem with designs invoked with multiple <b>-G</b> 
generic command line arguments when the generic names were the same.

</li>
<li>
Spaces in filenames are now supported in the Coverage Window.
</li>
<li>
The VHDL command <b>init_signal_spy</b> and the system task $init_signal_spy
now correctly report that the spying of Verilog Memories is not supported.
</li>
<li>
The following sequence: open file A, read part of file A, checkpoint, close 
file A, and finally open file A, opened file A at the location where the 
checkpoint occurred. It now will open file A at the start of file A.
</li>
<li>
The mgls.dll did not recognize the T-Guard dongles. This was a Windows and
Altera OEM problem only.
</li>
<li>
ModelSim crashed with a <b>restart</b> command or when <b>vsim</b> was 
subinvoked and the design contained virtual signals, functions, expressions, 
or slices (implicit virtuals).

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
When the Source Window is brought up the first time, the source colorization 
and highlighting of executable lines will not change dynamically but remain 
constant.<br>
For the case where there is an existing Source Window, and you do a <B>File >
Open</B>, and pick a file which has source lines that just fit the Source
Window, the same non-changeable colorization and highlighting occurs.

</li>
<li>
When multiple variables are selected in the Source Window, the variable
balloon (via Right Mouse Button) displays the same variable even when
the cursor is moved from one variable to the next.
</li>
<li>
Selected text in the Source Window or Transcript Window gets
unhighlighted when the cursor moves out of the window or to the toolbar
or menu bar. This is a Windows only issue.
</li>
<li>
Using the menu sequence <B>Design > Create a New Library</B> to create
a new library and mapping when a library already existed causes a 
window system error message to appear via a dialog box.
</li>
<li>
Executing the <B>vmap</B> command at the VSIM prompt does not update the
Library drop-down list.
</li>
<li>
When single-stepping in a .coverage_source Window, as long as the
context stays within the current file the coverage numbers can be seen
to increment with each step. If a step causes another source file to be
brought up, then the coverage numbers in the first column do not
increment correctly. Sometimes clicking on the name of the current
source file in the Coverage_Summary Window will correct the problem.
</li>
<li>
Start a compare, and do some compare runs. If a <B>compare reload</B> command
is unsuccessful, ModelSim does an implicit <B>compare end</B> without
providing an option to save results and the data is lost.
</li>
<li>
When ModelSim is invoked with "vsim -lib vhwork", the library entry in
the Design tab of the Load Design dialog box incorrectly shows the
default library "work" instead of the specified library "vhwork".
</li>
<li>
Loading a Tcl shared library fails on rs64 with the following message:
<code>ERROR: couldn't load file " testload.sl": readExports: bad magic 
number</code>
</li>
<li>
List Window Marker problems:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>If you add a bunch of signals to the List Window then select Markers
> Add Marker with nothing selected in the List Window, then the
2nd list line is highlighted. If you then click on another line
then no marker outline is left on the supposedly added marker
line.
<LI>If you click on some line and do Markers > Add Marker then the line
selected is marked with an outline but the second list line is
highlighted.
<LI>With a marker added on a particular line, if you then click on
various lines in the List Window then the marker outline
occasionally moves to some other line (usually the previously
selected line). Markers don't stay put.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
List Window scrolling problems:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>When using the Find dialog box to find signals, when the next
signal is outside of what is currently showing in the List Window,
the window is not scrolled to show the next item found.
<LI>If you do a find to the left and the search goes past the
beginning of the list to wrap around to the end of the list and
there's a lot of stuff in the list window that is out of view,
then the List Window scrolls right only one page even though that
does not bring the next selected item into view.
<LI>When doing a search forward on an item's values, the next line to
match is scrolled to the top line but the scroll bar stays the
full length of the scroll bar region. (This is in a List Window
where there aren't very many lines of data.)
<LI>The documentation for the List Window says that the up and down
arrow keys are supposed to move the line selection up or down one
line. The current behavior is that the up and down arrow keys
behave exactly the same as the TAB and shift-TAB keys (searches
for next transition).
</UL>

</li>
<li>
In some cases, Redhat 6.0 did not have coverage for the entire source
file. There is no problem with Redhat 6.1, 6.2 and 7.0.
</li>
<li>
In the Library page of the main window workspace, if a design unit is
selected and accessed with a right button click to Edit or Refresh or
Recompile, the following error will occur:<BR>
Error - cannot read work/_info: No such file or directory
<BR>
This bogus error message occurs only when the Library entry field in
the Library page is set to work, and work is logically mapped to
another library directory name.
<BR>
The work around is to set the Library entry field to the actual library
name instead of work.

</li>
<li>
A virtual signal foo is defined. The <B>checkpoint</B> command is issued.
Then, <B>virtual count</B> gives a count of 0. It should be 1. Nothing is saved
during <B>virtual save</B> command. The <B>virtual count</B> and <B>virtual 
save</B> commands before the <B>checkpoint</B> give the correct expected 
results. Also <B>virtual show</B> and <B>virtual describe foo</B> after the 
<B>checkpoint</B> give the correct expected results. <B>virtual count</B>
and<B>virtual save</B> are not working correctly. This bug also exists in 
5.4e

</li>
<li>
There is an inconsistency in how the path separator works when parsing
commands. Given that the path separator in the example below is "/ ",
.top.clk should not work.<BR>
<code>echo $PathSeparator<BR>
     # /<BR>
     exa /top/clk<BR>
     # 1<BR>
     exa /clk<BR>
     # 1<BR>
     exa clk<BR>
     # 1<BR>
     exa .top.clk<BR>
     # 1<BR>
     exa .clk<BR>

The following steps show a waveform compare problem.<P>

<LI>In the compare wizard, specify an opened dataset and a sim dataset
to be compared (via the compare start functionality).
<LI>Log some simulation signals.
<LI>The button "Update after simulation run" should NOT be checked.
<LI>Click the "Compute Diffs Now" button in the wizard. This message
was given: "Null time range for signal compare". The message could
be improved to "Cannot compare run because no simulation data
currently available"
<LI>Do a run 500.
<LI>Do a compare info command. The following message is given: "No
comparison differences" Does it mean my comparisons were all
matches? A better message choice might be "No available compare
data, please do a compare run or compare update first.".
</UL><P>
A compare run or compare update had not been done, so there should be
no compare results or data. The Wave Window is correct at this point;
the compare signal does not show any compare result.
</li>
<li>
No waves are displayed in the Wave Window for virtual constants or
virtual functions that are children of virtuals.
</li>
<li>
Virtual signals which are a concatenation of a signal from a <b>view
dataset</b> and a sim dataset show "-No Data-" in the Signals Window, even
after simulation.
</li>
<li>
A virtual signal containing a Verilog bit was expanded within a Signals
Window. Double clicking on this Verilog bit to invoke a <b>view
declaration</b> did not bring up the Source Window. If the Source Window
was already opened, it did not highlight this signal.

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Waveform Examine Popup Changes
<ol>
<li>The new preference variable, PrefWave(WaveformPopupEnabled), 
    is used to enable/disable this popup specifically.
<li>The value is now saved in the modelsim.tcl file when GUI preferences
    get saved (Main Window, <b>Options->Save Preferences</b>).
<li>The "Tooltip Examine" in the wave popup menu has been removed
    and the setting is now available on the Wave Window Display
    Properties dialog as Waveform Popup Enabled. (Wave Window, 
    <b>Edit->Display Properties</b>).
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Project View changes.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The compile order dialog box was replaced with in-place drag and drop.
<LI>The Project Window now has detection for "out-of-date" compiles.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Added a stronger compiler warning about not using OPEN on an actual individual
element of an array formal port when using the 1987 standard. This is
illegal in the 1993 standard and was revised to be illegal in the 1987
standard by the ISAC committee. However, due to customer complaints about
existing designs no longer working, we relaxed this to be a warning. 
Customers should be aware that that there are usages of this construct
that will cause design elaboration crashes, and these are not considered
a bug. This is the reason for the much stronger warning.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 5.5d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for code coverage and profiling for ModelSim PE. ModelSim PE 
requires the same licensing features as ModelSim SE to enable the 
functionality.
</li>
<li>
A new <b>vsim</b> switch, <b>-vcdstim</b>, has been added which is similar to 
the <b>-vcdread</b> switch except that the <b>-vcdstim</b> switch allows an
extended VCD file to be read in as stimulus.
</li>
<li>
Project View enhancements.<br>
<UL>
<LI>Added "out-of-date" compile detection in the project window.
<LI>Improved the performance of the project write procedures. 
<LI>Replaced the compile order dialog box with in-place drag and drop.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
New <b>vsim</b> switches were added to extend the violation regions of 
$setuphold and $recrem timing checks before zeroing.  Without these switches, 
during analysis of delay net delays, if it is determined that a solution of
delays can not be determined for a given set of timing checks 
the smallest negative setup/recovery limit is zeroed and the 
analysis is repeated. If no negative setup/recovery limits exist, 
then the smallest negative hold/removal limit is zeroed.
The analysis and limit zeroing is repeated until a solution is determined.

<p>
Use of either
<ul>
<li>-extend_tcheck_data_limit &lt;max_percent_of_limit_relaxation&gt;
<li>-extend_tcheck_ref_limit &lt;max_percent_of_limit_relaxation&gt;
</ul>

<p>
causes a one time extension of qualifying limits in an attempt to
provide a delay net delay solution prior to any limit zeroing. A
limit qualifies if it bounds a violation region which does not 
overlap a related violation region. For example,

<p>
<code>
   $setuphold( posedge clk, posedge d,   45,  70, notifier,,,dclk,dd);
<br>
   $setuphold( posedge clk, negedge d,  216, -68, notifier,,,dclk,dd);
</code>

<p>
are the same check type and have the same delay nets and thus are related.
The delay net delay analysis in this case does not provide a solution
as the required delay between d and dd of 68 for the negative hold could
cause a non-violating posedge d transition to be delayed on dd so that 
it could arrive after dclk for functional evaluation. By default
the -68 hold limit is set pessimistically to 0 to insure the correct
functional evaluation.

<p>
The other option is to use <b>-extend_tcheck_data_limit</b> to change the 
data limit of -68 to 44 (a 21 percent adjustment) or 
<b>-extend_tcheck_ref_limit</b>
to change the reference limit of 45 to 69 (a 16 percent adjustment).
