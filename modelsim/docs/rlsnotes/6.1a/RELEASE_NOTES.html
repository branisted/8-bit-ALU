<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 6.0x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is supported.  Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and Solaris 7, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>Solaris 8 and 9, gcc 3.3</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches <b>-87</b>, <b>-93</b>, or <b>-2002</b>, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>
The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5; Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.

CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:

For this beta release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software
being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
(i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
need to do anything.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit() task.</li>
<li>
The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit" variable in the modelsim.ini file.  By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.  The default time unit in SystemC can also be set using the sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like sc_clock or sc_time is created.</li>
<li>
vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar to the vsim command line options.</li>
<li>
Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option
has changed behavior somewhat.  This primarily affects
win32 and rs6000 users.

<OL>
<LI>You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename.
   That will be done for you automatically now.</LI>

<LI>There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'"
   to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line.</LI>
</OL>
The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat
files have been modified to show the correct flow now.
</li>
<li>
The following Windows platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:

<UL>
<LI>Windows 98
<LI>Windows ME
<LI>Windows NT 4.0
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.

<UL>Solaris 10 has the following limitations:

<LI>In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between 20ms and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error message, "Too few samples."  To workaround this problem, add the following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:<br>
set hires_tick=1<br>
This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris releases.
<LI>In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the system and produce a messages like "nfs server array not responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6296698.
<LI>In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any  PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will break under Solaris 10.
</UL>

</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
A focus issue caused hot-keys in the Wave window to not work under some circumstances.</li>
<li>
The online command syntax help window was hidden behind the Windows taskbar when the simulator's main window was displayed as full screen.</li>
<li>
The compile all icon was disabled when the sim tab was selected.</li>
<li>
A Tcl error message was generated while adding local object to the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Change radix for multiple list items did not work from Signals Properties dialog.</li>
<li>
A Wave windows opened using the <b>view</b> command with the <b>-title</b> option did not display the correct title in the Window menu.
</li>
<li>
Drag and Drop did not work with undocked List window.</li>
<li>
Invoking JobSpy from a shell (outside of vsim) with the <b>-gui</b> switch caused a TCL error.</li>
<li>
Wave Signal Search does not work when the Wave window is undocked and Source window opened. </li>
<li>
The Wave window toolbars did not correctly repopulate the Main window toolbar when the Wave window got docked.</li>
<li>
Changing the default run length in the simulator's toolbar did not take affect when a project was loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
There were problems with the $display family of routines in the optimized flow.</li>
<li>
If the 5th argument of the $signal_force system task is missing, the correct behavior is for its value to default to -1, meaning that no cancel period is specified. However, when the 6th argument was specified, a missing 5th argument mistakenly resulted in a cancel period of 0, causing the force to be immediately cancelled.</li>
<li>
vsim now generates an error message when the user tries to checkpoint the design and one or more process thread that has called dpi context import task is active. The error message contains the name of the process that called the dpi task.
The design can be checkpointed by running the simulation and checkpointing at a state when no import tasks are active. </li>
<li>
If you have multiple design roots where one or more is a Verilog configuration, restart of the design failed to load one or more of the design roots.</li>
<li>
A design optimized with vopt or <b>-fast</b> failed to trigger optimized "always" constructs in some cases.</li>
<li>
The file name specified in a Verilog `line compiler directive was not reported in the init_signal_spy messages.</li>
<li>
Condition and expression coverage were not properly handling the System Verilog
2-state types. This caused a crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
A variable primitive or continuous assignment delay within a generate scope failed if the variable was also declared in a generate scope.</li>
<li>
A bad value was assigned when a 2-state part-select greater than 32-bits wide was specified on the LHS of an assignment.</li>
<li>
vopt previously crashed when optimizing SystemVerilog packages containing constant functions used to define parameters.</li>
<li>
The type of local variables in SVA can now be composite type (e.g. struct).</li>
<li>
In some cases, a defparam to a localparam was silently ignored.  This now produces a warning.</li>
<li>
If module ports were declared using the .port_identifier(port_expression) syntax, and "port_expression" was used in input-to-input or output-to-output INTERCONNECT statements, SDF annotator did not find that port.</li>
<li>
The severity of the message for missing INTERCONNECT source ports was changed from error to warning, to be LRM compliant.</li>
<li>
In some cases using a parameter expression as the bound for a SystemVerilog dynamic array caused a simulation failure.</li>
<li>
The <b>vcd add -ports</B> command interfered with the <B>force -freeze</B> command.</li>
<li>
The $dumpoff record and the $dumpportsoff record in an evcd file now use the proper evcd syntax instead of using vcd syntax.</li>
<li>
Failures were encountered when doing a vcd dump of a design containing SystemVerilog class objects.</li>
<li>
Dumplimit on VCD files no longer counts the space taken up by the VCD file header.  This makes the limiting more repeatable even if the simulator version string in the header changes size in future releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
There was a problem with strings returned by tf_getcstringp not being null-terminated in some instances involving interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
vcom failed to give an error when missing protected bodies when the protected decl was in the package body instead of in the package.</li>
<li>
Exponentiation of integer by a negative exponent value (an error) is now caught in more cases.  Overflow of exponentiation value now produces a warning and returns 0 in all cases.</li>
<li>
<b>+acc=v</b> now disables an optimization that automaticlly converts variables
to constants. Currently vcom determines when a variable is written to only
once with a constant value and converts the variable to an equivalent constant.
The simulation results are unchanged but the <b>change</b> command may nolonger have any effect on changing the models behavior. Compiling with <b>+acc=v</b> causes the optimization to not occur.</li>
<li>
If a formal or record field name was the same as a protected type method, the
formal or record field name could not be used within a named association.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in certain cases when attempting to load an entity bound to a component with mismatched ports.</li>
<li>
A'LENGTH where A was class SIGNAL mode OUT formal parameter of a constrained array subtype returned an incorrect result.</li>
<li>
An internal error during compilation in vcom or vopt occurred after inlining a procedure that has a signal assignment to an out of scope signal. This only happened when that procedure was declared in another procedure which was declared in a process.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when an aliased object for a signal was created with a subtype specified outside the range of the original signal and an assignment was made to an alias object.</li>
<li>
There was a problem in the VHDL compiler when expression or condition coverage
was turned on, it ignored index expressions in which the index was a variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The port mode for some bits of a VHDL vector port were incorrect in some situations. This discrepency occured during elaboration and would only be detectable via the FLI.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Annotation of INTERCONNECT statements with different delay counts, to different bits of a wide port, caused random numbers to be annotated to bits that got annotated with INTERCONNECT delays with lesser delay counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator crashed when logging a variable of type bit field. Their was also an internal error when logging a variable of type array of integers.</li>
<li>
SystemC ports are now allowed to be left open/unbound.  A warning message is given for each unbound port in the design at the end of elaboration. A write to an unbound port leads to a fatal error.</li>
<li>
SystemC is now supported on Solaris 10 using gcc 3.3 distributed with the product.</li>
<li>
There was an internal error when logging variables of type array of integers.</li>
<li>
sc_fifo of type complex number is not supported but was erroneously allow. 
Accessing this type caused a crash. 


</li>
<li>
<b>view declaration</b> did not work for methods in the base class when the source of derived class and base class were compiled separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="psldefects"></a><b>PSL Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The statements in SVA sequence match items were not being sampled. The assignments and subroutine calls now use sampled value of variables rather than current value</li>
<li>
Endpoint with multiple instantiations did not work correctly.</li>
<li>
PSL endpoint did not work with the VHDL 'wait' statement.</li>
<li>
PSL endpoints crashed in vsim if VHDL attributes were applied on it.  Attributes are not supported for endpoints.</li>
<li>
A bit/part select of a hierarchical reference was not getting sampled correctly and caused memory stomping.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
In a mixed design, if a Verilog parameter name is not completely in lower case
characters and the VHDL generic associated with it is not an extended identifier,
type checking was not done. This resulted in invalid VHDL types being used to
set Verilog parameters. In certain cases this resulted in incorrect elaboration or simulation results if the VHDL type was not integer, real, or string. The check now performed.</li>
<li>
If a Verilog module was instantiated without using a component, the following 
error occurred if a port was left open:<br>
** Error: src/test.vhd(9): (vcom-1142) Illegal actual designator type in Verilog port "a" connection.<br>
** Error: src/test.vhd(10): VHDL Compiler exiting
</li>
<li>
The wrong module was loaded when a VHDL instance invoked a Verilog module
and the following conditions were true:
<UL>
<LI>Direct instantiation was used with an extended identifier.
<LI>The Verilog module name contained one or more upper case letters.
<LI>The Verilog module was not compiled with the <b>-93</b> switch.
<LI>The library contained another module with the same name but all lower 
case letters.
</UL></li>
<li>
In mixed language designs, the SDF annotator did not complain about missing INTERCONNECT source ports, if the <b>+multisource_int_delays</b> switch was specified on the vsim command line.</li>
<li>
Designs compiled in version 6.1 that contain direct instantiations of Verilog modules by VHDL design units did not record all dependence information. As a result, when the VHDL design units are refreshed to a later version, the following message will be printed:
<br>

"Dependencies have changed since the last compilation. Cannot refresh this design unit. Use the <b>-force_refresh</b> option to override this check."
<br>

Refreshing with the <b>-force_refresh</b> switch will result in a successful conversion to the current release. Subsequent design unit refreshes can be achieved with the <b>-refresh</b> switch.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Toggle coverage counts were not checked for overflow 32-bit integer values and displayed incorrect values when the overflow occurred.
</li>
<li>
This is a Windows only problem. In certain cases when the break key was hit during a simulation run, incorrect highlightling of executable line the Source window occurred. </li>
<li>
When re-optimizing a design with vopt, occasionally a design element was re-used, and mistakely had it's corresponding ".asm" file removed.
The error occurred when running vsim and looked similar to this:
<br>  
# ** Error: (vsim-3171) Could not find machine code for 'work.test3_lower(fast)'. <br>
# No such file or directory. (errno = ENOENT).

</li>
<li>
Waveform compare failed to report a difference when Lead and Trail tolerance values are specified and multiple events occurred within the tolerance window under some circumstances.</li>
<li>
Using curly braces around environment variable names inside a file specified with the <b>-f</b> option were not properly expanded.</li>
<li>
In <b>vcover</b> when all the lines in a module were excluded, the module still showed up in the <b>vcover report</b>.</li>
<li>

<li>
If you have code coverage on for part of your design and not for other parts,
and you look at reports for toggle coverage, you will find that design units
or instances without code coverage on may report toggle statistics. This 
happens when ports of the design unit or instance are connected to nets that
have toggle coverage turned on elsewhere in the design. We have no plans to

<li>
The wait() function in SystemC 2.1 must be invoked with the sc_core:: prefix to remove an ambiguity with the constructor for the system's union wait on HP(aCC). However this might not be sufficient to remove the ambiguity if the wait() function is invoked from the member function of a class template.  If the class template is derived from sc_module or sc_prim_channel then invoking the wait() member function of sc_module or sc_prim_channel solves the problem.  In that case    the wait() function has to be invoked as this: ->wait().</li>

<ul>
<li>
vlog was modified to treat each file within a compilation command line as a separate compilation unit as per section 19.3 of the IEEE P1800 Draft Standard for SystemVerilog.<br>

If you wish to have all files within the compilation command line treated as a single compilation unit, you can provide the new <b>-mfcu</b> (muti-file compilation unit) switch to vlog. Alternatively, you can set the value of MultiFileCompilationUnit within modelsim.ini to 1.</li>
<li>
VHDL code coverage has been improved so that condition and expression
coverage now handle BIT and BOOLEAN VHDL types. Also, when condition
or expression coverage cannot handle a particular statement, a reason
is now printed out. </li>
<li>
Adding user defined menus to the Wave window via user_hook stopped working.  This is due to a change in the user_hook parameter (wname). For the Wave window, the command <b>winfo toplevel $wname</b> must be used to obtain the toplevel widget path for the Wave window and this widget path must be used in the add_menu* procedures.</li>
<li>
In SystemC 2.1 the sc_exception class has been deprecated by making it a typedef for std::exception.  The sc_report class serves as the exception mechanism for the new reporting mechanism. It is derived from the std::exception class.  This change is in accordance to the SystemC 2.1 LRM.</li>
<li>
SystemC version 2.1 uses the std::string and std::vector data types from the C++ standard library in place of the sc_string and sc_pvector data types that were used in 2.0.1. 

For backward compatibility the original sc_string data type is now called sc_dt::sc_string_old.  A typedef is provided for sc_string to be defined as either std::string if the compile flag -DUSE_STD_STRING is passed to sccom or to sc_dt::sc_string_old if the compile flag -DUSE_SC_STRING_OLD is passed to sccom.

The sc_pvector data type is still provided for backward compatiblity, but is not used by the SystemC library. These changes are in accordance to the SystemC 2.1 LRM.</li>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.1a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Toggle coverage has been extended to VHDL enum and System Verilog enum types.
Counts are kept for each enumeration value and a signal is considered
"toggled" if all the enumerations have non-zero counts. In <b>toggle report</b>
and <b>coverage report</b>, uncovered enumeration values are printed. If the 
<b>-all</b> option is used, counts of all enumeration values are printed. </li>
<li>
Toggle coverage has been extended to VHDL integer types and System Verilog
integer types. SystemVerilog integer types are treated as 32-bit registers
and counts are kept for each bit. For VHDL integers, we keep a record of each
value the integer assumes, and an associated count. The maximum number of
values that are kept is determined by a limit variable and can be changed on 
a per-signal basis. The default is 100 values. This can be turned off
completely by including the vsim command line option
<b>-toggleNoIntegers</b>, or increased by setting the vsim command 
line option <b>-toggleMaxIntValues</b>, or setting <b>ToggleMaxIntValues</b>
in the modelsim.ini file, or setting the Tcl variable 
<b>toggleMaxIntValues</b>.</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage for VHDL enum and System Verilog enum signal types now supports
exclusions. You can exclude individual enums or ranges of enums from toggle
coverage and reporting. You can specify enum exclusions in source code pragmas
or using the <b>-exclude</b> argument to the <b>toggle add</b> command. See
the Users Manual for details.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command now generates a warning when changing the value
of a VHDL constant or generic.  This is because changing the value of
a constant may not be reflected at places the constant is used because of
compiler optimizations. This warning can be suppressed by setting the TCL
variable WarnConstantChange to 0.  This can also be set in the vsim
section of the modelsim.ini file.</li>
<li>
A Previous Query pick has been added to the popup menu in the Profile Details window. Selection of this item will change the query displayed in the Details window to the one immediately previous. This works similar to the way the  "Back" button in a web browser works.</li>
<li>
An Env pick has been added to the popup menu in the Profile Details and Structural Profile windows. Selection of this item will change the current environment to the currently selected item.</li>
<li>
Now a parameter can be assgined a value of '$' as described in section 6.3.1.2 of P1800 draft5 prelim4. The system task $isunbounded is also supported.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog classes declared in packages can now subclass from classes declared in other packages.</li>
<li>
Added SystemVerilog source templates.</li>
<li>
"parameter" declarations in generates are now supported and treated as localparams .  "localparam" type parameters are also supported.</li>
<li>
Integrated SystemC OSCI reference simulator 2.1 released on 21 April 2005.</li>
