   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and Solaris 7, gcc 3.2
          + Solaris 8 and 9, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328. CRITICAL
       LICENSING INFORMATION: For this beta release of the product, the FLEXlm
       licensing software being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it
       will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the
       license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater
       than  9.5. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this
       release will be FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of
       your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary
       to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and
       lmgrd contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you
       don't need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * The following Windows platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2
       release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * A focus issue caused hot-keys in the Wave window to not work under some
       circumstances.
     * The online command syntax help window was hidden behind the Windows
       taskbar when the simulator's main window was displayed as full screen.
     * The compile all icon was disabled when the sim tab was selected.
     * A Tcl error message was generated while adding local object to the Wave
       window.
     * Change  radix  for  multiple  list items did not work from Signals
       Properties dialog.
     * A Wave windows opened using the view command with the -title option did
       not display the correct title in the Window menu.
     * Drag and Drop did not work with undocked List window.
     * Invoking JobSpy from a shell (outside of vsim) with the -gui switch
       caused a TCL error.
     * Wave Signal Search does not work when the Wave window is undocked and
       Source window opened.
     * The Wave window toolbars did not correctly repopulate the Main window
       toolbar when the Wave window got docked.
     * Changing the default run length in the simulator's toolbar did not take
       affect when a project was loaded.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * There  were  problems  with the $display family of routines in the
       optimized flow.
     * If the 5th argument of the $signal_force system task is missing, the
       correct behavior is for its value to default to -1, meaning that no
       cancel  period  is  specified.  However, when the 6th argument was
       specified, a missing 5th argument mistakenly resulted in a cancel period
       of 0, causing the force to be immediately cancelled.
     * vsim now generates an error message when the user tries to checkpoint
       the design and one or more process thread that has called dpi context
       import  task is active. The error message contains the name of the
       process that called the dpi task. The design can be checkpointed by
       running the simulation and checkpointing at a state when no import tasks
       are active.
     * If  you  have multiple design roots where one or more is a Verilog
       configuration, restart of the design failed to load one or more of the
       design roots.
     * A  design optimized with vopt or -fast failed to trigger optimized
       "always" constructs in some cases.
     * The file name specified in a Verilog `line compiler directive was not
       reported in the init_signal_spy messages.
     * Condition and expression coverage were not properly handling the System
       Verilog 2-state types. This caused a crash in some cases.
     * A variable primitive or continuous assignment delay within a generate
       scope failed if the variable was also declared in a generate scope.
     * A bad value was assigned when a 2-state part-select greater than 32-bits
       wide was specified on the LHS of an assignment.
     * vopt  previously  crashed  when  optimizing SystemVerilog packages
       containing constant functions used to define parameters.
     * The type of local variables in SVA can now be composite type (e.g.
       struct).
     * In some cases, a defparam to a localparam was silently ignored. This now
       produces a warning.
     * If module ports were declared using the
       .port_identifier(port_expression) syntax, and "port_expression" was used
       in input-to-input or output-to-output INTERCONNECT statements, SDF
       annotator did not find that port.
     * The severity of the message for missing INTERCONNECT source ports was
       changed from error to warning, to be LRM compliant.
     * In  some  cases  using  a  parameter expression as the bound for a
       SystemVerilog dynamic array caused a simulation failure.
     * The vcd add -ports command interfered with the force -freeze command.
     * The $dumpoff record and the $dumpportsoff record in an evcd file now use
       the proper evcd syntax instead of using vcd syntax.
     * Failures were encountered when doing a vcd dump of a design containing
       SystemVerilog class objects.
     * Dumplimit on VCD files no longer counts the space taken up by the VCD
       file  header.  This makes the limiting more repeatable even if the
       simulator version string in the header changes size in future releases.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * There was a problem with strings returned by tf_getcstringp not being
       null-terminated in some instances involving interfaces.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * vcom failed to give an error when missing protected bodies when the
       protected decl was in the package body instead of in the package.
     * Exponentiation of integer by a negative exponent value (an error) is now
       caught in more cases. Overflow of exponentiation value now produces a
       warning and returns 0 in all cases.
     * +acc=v now disables an optimization that automaticlly converts variables
       to constants. Currently vcom determines when a variable is written to
       only  once  with  a constant value and converts the variable to an
       equivalent constant. The simulation results are unchanged but the change
       command may nolonger have any effect on changing the models behavior.
       Compiling with +acc=v causes the optimization to not occur.
     * If  a formal or record field name was the same as a protected type
       method, the formal or record field name could not be used within a named
       association.
     * The simulator crashed in certain cases when attempting to load an entity
       bound to a component with mismatched ports.
     * A'LENGTH  where  A was class SIGNAL mode OUT formal parameter of a
       constrained array subtype returned an incorrect result.
     * An internal error during compilation in vcom or vopt occurred after
       inlining a procedure that has a signal assignment to an out of scope
       signal. This only happened when that procedure was declared in another
       procedure which was declared in a process.
     * The simulator crashed when an aliased object for a signal was created
       with a subtype specified outside the range of the original signal and an
       assignment was made to an alias object.
     * There was a problem in the VHDL compiler when expression or condition
       coverage was turned on, it ignored index expressions in which the index
       was a variable.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * The port mode for some bits of a VHDL vector port were incorrect in some
       situations. This discrepency occured during elaboration and would only
       be detectable via the FLI.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * Annotation of INTERCONNECT statements with different delay counts, to
       different bits of a wide port, caused random numbers to be annotated to
       bits that got annotated with INTERCONNECT delays with lesser delay
       counts.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * The simulator crashed when logging a variable of type bit field. Their
       was also an internal error when logging a variable of type array of
       integers.
     * SystemC ports are now allowed to be left open/unbound. A warning message
       is given for each unbound port in the design at the end of elaboration.
       A write to an unbound port leads to a fatal error.
     * SystemC is now supported on Solaris 10 using gcc 3.3 distributed with
       the product.
     * There was an internal error when logging variables of type array of
       integers.
     * sc_fifo of type complex number is not supported but was erroneously
       allow. Accessing this type caused a crash.
     * view declaration did not work for methods in the base class when the
       source of derived class and base class were compiled separately.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * The statements in SVA sequence match items were not being sampled. The
       assignments and subroutine calls now use sampled value of variables
       rather than current value
     * Endpoint with multiple instantiations did not work correctly.
     * PSL endpoint did not work with the VHDL 'wait' statement.
     * PSL endpoints crashed in vsim if VHDL attributes were applied on it.
       Attributes are not supported for endpoints.
     * A bit/part select of a hierarchical reference was not getting sampled
       correctly and caused memory stomping.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * In a mixed design, if a Verilog parameter name is not completely in
       lower case characters and the VHDL generic associated with it is not an
       extended  identifier, type checking was not done. This resulted in
       invalid VHDL types being used to set Verilog parameters. In certain
       cases this resulted in incorrect elaboration or simulation results if
       the VHDL type was not integer, real, or string. The check now performed.
     * If a Verilog module was instantiated without using a component, the
       following error occurred if a port was left open:
       ** Error: src/test.vhd(9): (vcom-1142) Illegal actual designator type in
       Verilog port "a" connection.
       ** Error: src/test.vhd(10): VHDL Compiler exiting
     * The wrong module was loaded when a VHDL instance invoked a Verilog
       module and the following conditions were true:
          + Direct instantiation was used with an extended identifier.
          + The Verilog module name contained one or more upper case letters.
          + The Verilog module was not compiled with the -93 switch.
          + The library contained another module with the same name but all
            lower case letters.
     * In mixed language designs, the SDF annotator did not complain about
       missing INTERCONNECT source ports, if the +multisource_int_delays switch
       was specified on the vsim command line.
     * Designs compiled in version 6.1 that contain direct instantiations of
       Verilog modules by VHDL design units did not record all dependence
       information. As a result, when the VHDL design units are refreshed to a
       later version, the following message will be printed:
       "Dependencies have changed since the last compilation. Cannot refresh
       this design unit. Use the -force_refresh option to override this check."
       Refreshing with the -force_refresh switch will result in a successful
       conversion to the current release. Subsequent design unit refreshes can
       be achieved with the -refresh switch.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1a
     * Toggle coverage counts were not checked for overflow 32-bit integer
       values and displayed incorrect values when the overflow occurred.
     * This is a Windows only problem. In certain cases when the break key was
       hit during a simulation run, incorrect highlightling of executable line
       the Source window occurred.
     * When re-optimizing a design with vopt, occasionally a design element was
       re-used, and mistakely had it's corresponding ".asm" file removed. The
       error occurred when running vsim and looked similar to this:
       #   **   Error:  (vsim-3171)  Could  not  find  machine  code  for
       'work.test3_lower(fast)'.
       # No such file or directory. (errno = ENOENT).
     * Waveform compare failed to report a difference when Lead and Trail
       tolerance values are specified and multiple events occurred within the
       tolerance window under some circumstances.
     * Using curly braces around environment variable names inside a file
       specified with the -f option were not properly expanded.
     * In vcover when all the lines in a module were excluded, the module still
       showed up in the vcover report.
     * The vcover report command interpreted -du as -dumptables. The -du option
       is now properly interpreted.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.1a
     * If you have code coverage on for part of your design and not for other
       parts, and you look at reports for toggle coverage, you will find that
       design units or instances without code coverage on may report toggle
       statistics. This happens when ports of the design unit or instance are
       connected to nets that have toggle coverage turned on elsewhere in the
       design. We have no plans to fix this.
     * The wait() function in SystemC 2.1 must be invoked with the sc_core::
       prefix to remove an ambiguity with the constructor for the system's
       union wait on HP(aCC). However this might not be sufficient to remove
       the ambiguity if the wait() function is invoked from the member function
       of a class template. If the class template is derived from sc_module or
       sc_prim_channel then invoking the wait() member function of sc_module or
       sc_prim_channel solves the problem. In that case the wait() function has
       to be invoked as this: ->wait().

   Product Changes to 6.1a
     * vlog was modified to treat each file within a compilation command line
       as a separate compilation unit as per section 19.3 of the IEEE P1800
       Draft Standard for SystemVerilog.
       If  you wish to have all files within the compilation command line
       treated as a single compilation unit, you can provide the new -mfcu
       (muti-file compilation unit) switch to vlog. Alternatively, you can set
       the value of MultiFileCompilationUnit within modelsim.ini to 1.
     * VHDL code coverage has been improved so that condition and expression
       coverage now handle BIT and BOOLEAN VHDL types. Also, when condition or
       expression coverage cannot handle a particular statement, a reason is
       now printed out.
     * Adding user defined menus to the Wave window via user_hook stopped
       working. This is due to a change in the user_hook parameter (wname). For
       the Wave window, the command winfo toplevel $wname must be used to
       obtain the toplevel widget path for the Wave window and this widget path
       must be used in the add_menu* procedures.
     * In SystemC 2.1 the sc_exception class has been deprecated by making it a
       typedef for std::exception. The sc_report class serves as the exception
       mechanism  for the new reporting mechanism. It is derived from the
       std::exception class. This change is in accordance to the SystemC 2.1
       LRM.
     * SystemC version 2.1 uses the std::string and std::vector data types from
       the C++ standard library in place of the sc_string and sc_pvector data
       types that were used in 2.0.1. For backward compatibility the original
       sc_string data type is now called sc_dt::sc_string_old. A typedef is
       provided  for sc_string to be defined as either std::string if the
       compile   flag   -DUSE_STD_STRING   is   passed  to  sccom  or  to
       sc_dt::sc_string_old if the compile flag -DUSE_SC_STRING_OLD is passed
       to  sccom. The sc_pvector data type is still provided for backward
       compatiblity, but is not used by the SystemC library. These changes are
       in accordance to the SystemC 2.1 LRM.

   New Features Added to 6.1a
     * Toggle coverage has been extended to VHDL enum and System Verilog enum
       types.  Counts are kept for each enumeration value and a signal is
       considered "toggled" if all the enumerations have non-zero counts. In
       toggle report and coverage report, uncovered enumeration values are
       printed. If the -all option is used, counts of all enumeration values
       are printed.
     * Toggle coverage has been extended to VHDL integer types and System
       Verilog integer types. SystemVerilog integer types are treated as 32-bit
       registers and counts are kept for each bit. For VHDL integers, we keep a
       record of each value the integer assumes, and an associated count. The
       maximum number of values that are kept is determined by a limit variable
       and can be changed on a per-signal basis. The default is 100 values.
       This can be turned off completely by including the vsim command line
       option -toggleNoIntegers, or increased by setting the vsim command line
       option  -toggleMaxIntValues,  or setting ToggleMaxIntValues in the
       modelsim.ini file, or setting the Tcl variable toggleMaxIntValues.
     * Toggle coverage for VHDL enum and System Verilog enum signal types now
       supports exclusions. You can exclude individual enums or ranges of enums
       from toggle coverage and reporting. You can specify enum exclusions in
       source code pragmas or using the -exclude argument to the toggle add
       command. See the Users Manual for details.
     * The change command now generates a warning when changing the value of a
       VHDL  constant or generic. This is because changing the value of a
       constant may not be reflected at places the constant is used because of
       compiler optimizations. This warning can be suppressed by setting the
       TCL variable WarnConstantChange to 0. This can also be set in the vsim
       section of the modelsim.ini file.
     * A Previous Query pick has been added to the popup menu in the Profile
       Details window. Selection of this item will change the query displayed
       in  the Details window to the one immediately previous. This works
       similar to the way the "Back" button in a web browser works.
     * An Env pick has been added to the popup menu in the Profile Details and
       Structural Profile windows. Selection of this item will change the
       current environment to the currently selected item.
     * Now a parameter can be assgined a value of '$' as described in section
       6.3.1.2 of P1800 draft5 prelim4. The system task $isunbounded is also
       supported.
     * SystemVerilog classes declared in packages can now subclass from classes
       declared in other packages.
     * Added SystemVerilog source templates.
     * "parameter" declarations in generates are now supported and treated as
       localparams . "localparam" type parameters are also supported.
     * Integrated SystemC OSCI reference simulator 2.1 released on 21 April
       2005.
