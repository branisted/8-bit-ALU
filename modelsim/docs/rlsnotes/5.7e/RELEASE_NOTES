   Key Information
     * The following platform will be discontinued as of the ModelSim 5.8
       release:
          + AIX 4.2
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.7 Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the 5.7e release. If you are migrating to the 5.7e release from
       5.6x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes for product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7 patch releases. The previous version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
       attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * In the next major release, the linux platform executables will be
       built on RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1. This version is
       compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher. RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will
       be supported for one release with a new platform vco.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * The simulator could not load a design whose name was an escaped
       identifier (DR 00029779).
     * A previous invocation with a generic was remembered even when it
       was not part of a Simulation Configuration.
     * Inconsistent warnings occurred when invoking on edited HDL code.
     * A generic value mapping that was set in a simulation configuration
       was not used when the project simulation was invoked (DR
       00103797).
     * The compare info command did not always output results. This
       occurred most often when using the -write <filename> option and
       there were no compare differences. Now the command will always
       produce a summary report even when there are no miscompares.
     * A simulation configuration would not allow the use of multiple do
       files.
     * In the C Debug tool during init mode, it was possible to delete or
       disable reserved breakpoints thereby preventing a design from
       being completely loaded.
     * In some cases a function parameter was the wrong size in the
       Variables window (DR 00080624).
     * The interpretation of end-of-line in .do files was different
       between UNIX and DOS. Now the TCL end-of-line recognition mode is
       used.
     * Searching for Verilog net values greater than 32 bits did not work
       in the Wave or List windows.
     * Projects did not track warnings.
     * The Source window incorrectly displayed a source file as though it
       were empty after externally editing the file and restarting the
       simulator.
     * Dragging an instance from the Instance Coverage window to the Wave
       window failed.
     * Verilog named events were not displayed correctly in the List
       window.
     * Expanded regions or signals in the Structure or Signals windows
       collapsed after an attempt to add a non-existent signal to the
       Wave window or List window.
     * A hang occurred during the restart command if the Structure window
       was sorted in any order other than the default declaration order.
     * The compare option -noignoreVlogStrength did not work correctly.
       This option can be accessed via the command line or from the
       "Ignore Verilog Strength" checkbutton in the Compare Options
       dialog.
     * Logged signals within Verilog named blocks were not visible when
       the WLF file was opened in -view mode.
     * The Expression Builder failed to save expressions containing
       spaces.
     * Virtual signals failed to handle VHDL BOOLEAN types correctly.
     * The Expression Builder failed to display the reason for a parsing
       failure. The detailed reason is now displayed.
     * In rare cases, the WLF reverse search mechanism would fail to find
       a signal transition.
     * Editing dofiles in a project executed the dofile instead. A new
       menu item has been added to execute the dofiles.
     * On Windows platforms only, in some cases an error occurred when
       the vsim.wlf file was in use. This resulted in an invalid wlf file
       name or a simulation crash.
     * The force command accepted at most three comma-separated indices
       within a single set of parentheses.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * A design containing a $value$plusargs system task resulted in a
       false "Second argument must be a modifiable variable" elaboration
       error message if the design was compiled with -fast.
     * A design compiled with -fast might not have properly computed
       posedge or negedge events on vector nets that were determined by
       the compiler to be "vectored" nets.
     * Filenames reported in compiler errors immediately after `includes
       were incorrect.
     * The nolog command did not match logged ports of optimized cells.
     * The system task $sscanf was returning 1 for early miscompares
       instead of 0.
     * When optimizing designs with -fast, if the size of the design was
       large and a 32-bit version of vlog was running, spurious errors
       were generated in some cases. Most errors appeared to be caused by
       wires/registers not exisiting or multiple copies existing. (For
       example, an error stating a named object already exists.) These
       errors were generated during the optimization pass.
     * Indexed part-selects might not have simulated correctly when
       inside generate loops.
     * The count expression of a repeat statement was truncated rather
       than rounded if the expression was of type real.
     * Changes to disable timing check messages and X generation (using
       the tcheck_set command) were not sticking when the timing check's
       initial limit value was zero.
     * A $monitor call containing a hierarchical reference to an
       optimized cell port in some cases crashed the simulator.
     * Compiling a design containing multiple always blocks having event
       controls on bit-selects of the same vector register resulted in an
       internal compiler error in some cases.
     * A hierarchical reference where the first name in the path refers
       to the name of the module containing the reference resulted in a
       compile error if the design was compiled with -fast.
     * The Verilog compiler accepted strings that extended across lines
       (this is not syntactically correct). It now produces a warning
       when this occurs, unless +nowarnEXTSTR is used.
     * The Verilog LRM states that it is illegal to have multiple drivers
       on specify path destination ports. Before version 5.7, ModelSim
       did not enforce this even though the simulation results in these
       cases could be incorrect. In 5.7, ModelSim started generating an
       error. This caused elaboration errors in some scenarios, forcing
       users to go through extensive rewriting to achieve desired
       funtionality. This error message has been removed and the
       simulator modified such that it gives the correct results in the
       case of multiple drivers.
     * Some cases of ternary expressions where both choices were
       equivalent constant values resulted in a compiler internal error.
     * Non-blocking assignments didn't evaluate correctly in some cases
       when used with sequential UDPs (+nocheckSUDP).
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * The "workarea" field of the current instance was restored to its
       -elab value instead of being reset to NULL during a -load_elab.
       Since the data it pointed to was not restored (instead, being
       regenerated via the playback of tf calls during -load_elab), it
       essentially pointed to uninitialized data.
     * Verilog generate instances were not accessible through the PLI.
     * In rare cases Verilog designs crashed due to an optimization
       related defect.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * When designs were compiled with -O0, in some cases indexing into
       REAL arrays caused the simulator to erroneously report index
       out-of-range errors. This occurred only on 64-bit platforms.
     * ModelSim allowed character literals to be aliased to
       non-enumeration literals as prohibited by IEEE Std 1076-2002.
     * If a scalar alias of a vector signal was driven within multiple
       processes, incorrect simulation results or crashes occurred in
       some cases.
     * Type descriptors for default values of generics appearing in
       entities were not correctly initialized when bound to component
       instantiations by configurations.
     * A synchronous process with an asynchronous reset could have
       behaved incorrectly during reset. The following conditions must
       have occurred:
       1) The reset portion of the process must have read a signal.
       2) The signal being read did not appear in the sensitivity list.
       3) The signal being read changed value after the reset condition
       became true.
       4) The clock signal must have had an event other than the
       rising/falling edge that triggered the flip-flop.
       If all of these conditions were true, then the flip-flop would
       have an incorrect value on its output.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * When using the -elab_defer_fli switch, the simulator crashed when
       generating the elab file if Verilog code was present in the
       design.
     * If a fatal error occurred while executing an FLI entry point
       initialization routine, then subsequent attempts to load a design
       within the same invocation of the ModelSim application resulted in
       corrupted generic and port lists being passed to FLI applications.
     * mti_GetParentSignal() in some cases crashed the simulator when the
       parent of a VHDL signal was a constant value within a Verilog
       scope.
     * mti_FirstProcess() and mti_NextProcess() in some cases returned an
       invalid process handle due to optimization of processes. Use of
       the invalid process handle sometimes caused the simulator to
       crash.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * A VITAL SDF multisource interconnect delay that referred to a
       non-existent port caused a crash in some cases.
     * The VITAL 2000 vital_timing VHDL source code had an error that
       showed up under certain conditions when coming out of a
       negative-preemptive glitch. This problem also existed in the
       -novital1 acceleration but not in the normal ModelSim VITAL
       acceleration.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * A transport interconnect delay applied to a path from a VITAL cell
       to an optimized Verilog cell crashed the simulator in some cases.
     * A Verilog module instantiated underneath a VHDL generate statement
       could not be SDF annotated.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.7e
     * In rare cases, single-stepping produced the error "Cannot
       disassemble opcode!".
     * The simulator crashed on loading a design containing SmartModels
       or hardware models if within the same invocation of the ModelSim
       application a previous design was loaded that did not contain
       SmartModels or hardware models.
     * If a fatal error occurred while loading a hardware model, then
       subsequent attempts to load hardware models within the same
       invocation of the ModelSim application could result in a crash.
     * Wlfman crashed when attempting to filter a WLF file containing
       Verilog "generate" regions.
     * Memory corruption occurred in very rare cases after a warm
       restore.
     * The code coverage reload command failed when a design contained a
       case statement with over 1000 branches. The limit was increased to
       10,000 branches.
     * Finding and examining objects declared in VHDL subprograms did not
       always work.
     * The find and examine commands did not always handle multiple
       contiguous path separators. (e.g. "//tb/clk")
     * When the user registered a dataset snapshot -time command and did
       a run -all, the simulation would hang in the case of a testbench
       that did not have an explicit stop.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7e
     * DR 00029779/SC311022 - Extended Identifiers: "Design>Load Design
       ..." leads to Error.
     * DR 00103797/SC336642 - Generic set in simulation configuration did
       not load when project simulation was invoked.
     * DR 00123733 - Crash with Modelsim 5.7c when loading design.
       The design in this case involved clocked processes that were
       sensitive to record signals.
     * DR 00080624/SC302187 - Function parameter has wrong size in
       Variables window.
     * DR 00105267/SC338275 - A virtual signal could not be created,
       deleted and then re-created using the same name.
     * DR 00126653 - Overflow error when reloading coverage data.
       The coverage reload command failed when a design contained a case
       statement with over 1000 branches. The limit was increased to
       10,000 branches.
     * DR 00125804 - Expression builder can not save expressions
       containing spaces.
     * DR 00125931 - wlfman core dumps when the original VHDL source code
       contained generate statements.
     * DR 00128786 - Unresolved reference error when using verilog
       generate.
     * DR 00126684 - SDF annotate error for generated instance.
     * DR 00126719 - Wave Compare issue.
     * DR 00030186/SC311137 - VCD: Difference between MTI and Leapfrog
       VCD files.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Known Defects in 5.7e
     * When using code coverage for VHDL, if you have an entity
       declaration containing concurrent assertion statements, and that
       entity declaration is in a separate file from the associated
       architecture, misleading indications of executable lines will show
       up in the architecture file corresponding to line numbers of the
       assertion statements in the entity. The workaround is to put the
       entity and architecture in the same file.
     * The examine -expr <expr> command requires the signals in the
       expression to be logged. If the signals were not logged, the error
       message was not helpful enough.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Product Changes to 5.7e
     * The behavior of the Source window Find dialog box was changed in
       several ways:
       1) Focus remains in the dialog box instead of changing to the
       Source window.
       2) The <Return> key may be used to repeat the last search.
       3) The entry box text is reselected so that typing will replace
       the current search string with a new one.
       4) The Source window's selection is now exported and is available
       for middle-mouse-button paste operations in other windows and (on
       UNIX) other applications.
       5) The entry box selected text is no longer exported.
       The net effect of all these changes makes the Find dialog much
       easier and more intuitive to use.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   New Features Added to 5.7e
     * A "Remove All (Panes and Signals)" menu item has been added to the
       Edit menu in the Wave window. This will remove all signals from
       the window and all additional window panes, leaving the window in
       its original state as if just opened.
     * Code coverage exclusion files now support environment variables in
       the file path name fields. The coverage report command also
       supports environment variables in the -file and -source options.
     * Optimized Verilog cell support for continuous assignments
       containing ternary operators.
