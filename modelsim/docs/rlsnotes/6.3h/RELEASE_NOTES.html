<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3h</b>
<ul>
<li>
The OK button in the Merge Dialog of Verification Management Browser was not responsive to Instance and design unit entries.
</li>
<li>
When running in post-simulation mode, adding items to the Dataflow window using the popup menu in the Objects window did not work correctly.
</li>
<li>
When using analog formatting and viewing the waveform's "min/max" values in either the Wave Properties dialog or the Format > Analog (Custom) dialog, it was possible for the displayed values to appear to have rounding inprecision. For example a value of "13.0" might be displayed as "12.999999999999998". This has been fixed so the displayed values will match however they would appear in the Wave's "Value" pane.</li>
<li>
The first paste within a source file would not result in the SAVE action becoming enabled. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>
The Force and Change picks in the Objects window popup menu sometimes had incorrect enable/disable state for System Verilog design items.
</li>
<li>
The balloon help in the Wave window Messages pane did not work as expected for high zoom-in levels.
</li>
<li>
Using the "Rescale to fit Y data" or "Show menu of other actions->View Min Y" or "Show menu of other actions->View Max Y" menu picks from the Analog sidebar menu would result in a Tcl stacktrace if there were gaps in the logged data (i.e., intervals of No_Data).</li>
<li>
The <b>nolog</b> command with a wildcard would cause a crash when it tried to stop logging on signals that had not been logged.
</li>
<li>
The <b>nolog -all</b> command would prevent updates on some array signals.
</li>
<li>
Logging VHDL variable and generics which were NULL arrays could produce a WLF file that would cause a crash when read post-simulation with <b>vsim -view</b> or <b>dataset open</b>.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-sdftyp</b> option failed to load design if the specified path has extended identifier.
</li>
<li>
Dataflow operations using certain mixed-language designs could cause vsim to crash.
</li>
<li>
Packed System Verilog multi-dimensional arrays could not be expanded in the Wave window.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3h</b>
<ul>
<li>
Continuous assignments to a slice of a variable inside a generate loop, where the slice was bound by the generate variable, would not set the correct bits of the variable.</li>
<li>
vlog sometimes caused an "Unexpected signal: 11" when reading and writing to a bit-select of a member of a structure inside always_comb.
</li>
<li>
A Warning is now issued for specification of an array as 'randc' (cyclic random). The 'randc' modifier is not supported for arrays (or queues).
The solver treats these variables as 'rand' (random without the cyclic
characteristic). Previously the solver was silent about treating 'randc' arrays as simply 'rand'.

The 'randc' modifier for arrays is supported in the 6.4 release.</li>
<li>
Calling a super class constructor inside a member function of a derived class might have given errors like:<br>
<code>
** Error: 1.v(8): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vrslvdecl.c(6082) stmt<br>
** Error: 1.v(8): Verilog Compiler exiting<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
Usage of non-simple delay expressions in an event triggering statement, such as in:
<br>
<code>
->>  #(<b>delay_a - delay_b</b>) ev;
</code>
<br>
might have resulted in an "Unexpected Signal 11".
</li>
<li>
Array Locator Methods, <b>unique()</b> & <b>unique_index()</b> have been updated as per mantis item 978.<br>
unique() called on an array will now return a queue, consisting of one and only one entry for each of the values found in the array.<br>
Similarly, unique_index() returns indices of all elements with unique values or whose expression evaluates to a unique value. The queue returned contains one and only one entry for each of the values found in the array.<br>
<br>
For example for an array A = '{1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 6, 9, 2, 6, 9}<br>

# A.unique() is '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}<br>
# A.unique_index() is '{0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 2, 9}

</li>
<li>
Interface and program design elements were not allowing defparam statements within their bodies.</li>
<li>
The Verilog compiler crashed with very large floating point values, such as 1.7976931348623157e+308, given as a parameter.
</li>
<li>
System Verilog designs with user packages named "avm_pkg" did not correctly refresh.
</li>
<li>
Constant functions that contained references to parameters or other constant functions sometimes caused vsim to crash during elaboration.</li>
<li>
Instantiation of a VHDL design unit from within a Verilog generate block could fail if the design unit contains scalar generics whose values are inferred by vopt. The simulator will erroneously produce the following error message:
<pre>
** Error: (vsim-3171) Could not find machine code for '...'
</pre>
</li>
<li>
System Verilog "foreach" when used to iterate over an array which has its dimensions defined as an unsigned integer might have given wrong results in incremental compile mode. 
</li>
<li>
Declaring a parameter internal to a non-parameterized class (for example "<code>class C; parameter SIZE=32; endclass</code>") caused an elaboration crash.
</li>
<li>
Functions declared in modports could not be declared to have ref arguments. The compile issues a error stating the function must be automatic or the keyword
automatic is not allowed.</li>
<li>
Using a dynamic array of named-events inside a class caused vsim to crash.</li>
<li>
Usage of a non-simple slice width for a streaming concat, such as:<br>
<code>
{ << <b>foo()</b> {d} };
</code>
might have given an internal error like:<br>
<code>** Error: bug.v(11): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vfold.c(1746)</code>
</li>
<li>
Under some conditions, if two always blocks had the same sensitivity list and
contained if statements, optimization could incorrect optimize away the body of
one if statement.</li>
<li>
Using a part-select of an unpacked array as part of the streaming concat expression on the LHS would sometimes result in a vsim crash.</li>
<li>
$size when called on an array of parameterized class objects would result in this internal error:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgentd.c(339)
</code>
</li>
<li>
Dereferencing an element of a class through a virtual interface (i.e., "vif.clshandle.var") would result in the error message:<br>
<code>
Illegal virtual interface dereference.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Issue in Verilog incomplete pragma is fixed.</li>
<li>
Expressions having a mix of "real" and "reg" types produced incorrect results in some cases.</li>
<li>
Errors would be reported by the simulator when attempting to perform restart on designs with configurations. In incremental (novopt) mode, a stacktrace would often occur. In vopt mode, when vopt is invoked automatically by the simulator (2-step flow), the simulator would report the following error:
<pre>
** Error: (vsim-8345) Unable to find original top-level design units for optimized design "_opt".
</pre>
</li>
<li>
vopt would sometimes report errors as being in protected code when they were actually in public, non-encrypted code.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog package compilation was not respecting <b>-Lf</b> library path directives. 
</li>
<li>
Simulations using pulse_e_style_ondetect could hang.</li>
<li>
With <b>-G</b> and <b>+acc=r</b> specified at the same time in vopt, an error message was displayed some times like:<br> 
<code>
Invalid override of parameter 'P' whose value may no longer be modified.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Within some contexts such as a parameterized class, an invalid error could be reported when assigning a enum value to an array of the enum type.</li>
<li>
In some cases, optimizations would incorrectly apply forces when nets were connected via interface ports.</li>
<li>
In some complex assignments to multibit registers where distinct processes
were sensitive to different bits of the reg, it was possible that a fatal error could be encountered during simulation.
</li>
<li>
The vlog compiler crashed if a time literal (like "1ns") was used as a default task or function argument value and the task or function was declared in a package or $unit scope without a specified time precision.</li>

<ul>
<li>
An indexed name formed with a prefix of a type originally declared as an incomplete type and later fully defined as an array type would sometimes crash the vcom compiler.</li>
<li>
In some cases, vopt could infer incorrect values for generics, or infer none, when configurations specified bindings of distinct architectures of a single entity. If no generic values were inferred, and the entity specified no default value, the following error message would be issued:<br>
<code>
** Fatal: (vsim-3350) Generic '...' has not been given a value.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some case a VHDL design would crash during elaboration if a process contained signal assignments where the longest static prefix of the target was out of bounds.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, a std_logic_vector passed to an element of an array of std_logic_vectors would fail with an error message about a mismatch.</li>
<li>
If a subprogram was declared within a process declaration region and the subprogram was inlined the compile time or vopt time grew rapidly base on the
number of times the subprogram was used. The time could get so bad that the compilation or optimization would not complete.</li>
<li>
In some instances when a signal array appeared twice in a port map one of them was left unconnected.
</li>
<li>
For some cases where name of block generic is similar to the generic of parent entity, wrong generic propagation was taking place.
</li>
<li>
An expanded name whose prefix was one of the packages in one of the libraries shipped with the product could not be used in a user-defined package of the same name.  For example, a user-defined package named "numeric_std", if it contained an expanded name "ieee.numeric_std.signed", even though legal, would cause the compiler error:<br>
<code>
Expanded name prefix cannot denote design unit being analyzed.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some cases when doing default binding at elaboration, if multiple entities with the same name existed in more than one library the default entity was taken from the wrong library.</li>
<li>
In some cases, an optimization prevented rows of a two dimensional array from being assigned with up to date values of a local variable.
</li>
<li>
vcom was resulting in the corruption of _parsed.vhd file in refresh mode.</li>
<li>
If multiple logical libraries are mapped to the same physical library and a configuration configures a design unit in that physical library, an optimized design may have crashed when loaded or during runtime. This occurred when the design unit could be referenced via multiple logical library names and the optimization information was only found via one of those library names.</li>

Verilog single-bit vectors could not be connected to VHDL bit/std_logic, when binding to VHDL target scopes. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>
Verilog hierarchical references starting from module name were not getting resolved, when binding to VHDL target scopes using SystemVerilog bind construct.
</li>
<li>
The <b>vcd dumpports</b> command failed to capture "same state" contention in the VCD file on an inout port in the case of a Verilog DUT underneath a VHDL testbench. Specifically, transitions from one driver "on" to multiple drivers "on" without a state change were not recorded.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3h</b>
<ul>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb) will now display warnings for either of the following conditions:
<ul><li>If no testplan scopes resulted from the import, or</li>
    <li>If no testplan scopes contained design coverage point links.</li></ul>

Note that the xml2ucdb utility cannot verify the accuracy of the coverage point links -- only whether links were or were not specified in the testplan.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb) will now ignore leading whitespace in potential data fields when looking for field labels (ie: "WEIGHT:", "GOAL:", etc).</li>
<li>
In some cases, the "Show Covered" and "Show Missing" buttons on the branch and condition detailed coverage pages would not show *all* the covered/missing coverage items.</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in which generate blocks are not reported for code coverage after
restart, in no-vopt mode.</li>
<li>
Missed Coverage window displayed excluded FSM states and transitions in live simulation mode.</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem in which VHDL generate blocks in vopt would not show  
code coverage data.
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem in which a crash would occur if a VHDL architecture was 
compiled with code coverage on, and the configuration was compiled without  
code coverage on.
</li>
<li>
Having the VHDL clocked flip/flop "clkOpt" optimization enabled when code
coverage is on has caused a great deal of confusion among users. With this
optimization, processes that implement an edge-triggered register with reset
are optimized so that the processes are invoked only on the correct edge of
the clock, or reset. This causes branch coverage to record zero counts for the other
edge of the clock, which has caused a great deal of confusion. Consequently,
we now disable the clkOpt optimization when CoverOpt is less than 4 (the
default is 3). Turning off this optimization does slow down simulation. If you
still want clkOpt enabled, use CoverOpt = 4.
</li>
<li>
A performance problem has been fixed with code coverage when there are large
numbers of toggles.</li>
<li>
When VHDL with VITAL cells is compiled in Vopt flow with FSM coverage turned on, Vsim sometimes crashes during elaboration with following error:
<br>
<code>** Fatal: Internal error: ../../../src/vsim/cover.c (4070) </code>
<br><br>
It is fixed now.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>

<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.3h</b>

<li>
Creating a mapping with uppercase WORK can cause the following error after optimizing:
<br>
<code>
# ** Warning: (vsim-56) Problem with optimized design dependency file "/u/project/mlibs/MTB/_opt/_deps" - file is corrupted.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some cases, the color in the Wave window of a composite bus would display as red (implying an unknown member value) when all member values were known values.
</li>
<li>
The <b>vsim -msgmode</b> WLF option incorrectly suppressed elaboration error messages which should have been reported in the transcript.
</li>
<li>
When <b>-gen_xml</b> was used with vcom or vlog, the _info file could be modified.

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.3h</b>
<ul>
<li>
Syntax highlighting may not function properly in the Source window (all the source is shown as plain text). You can fix this problem by editing ~/hte/v2_38/hte.ini (where ~ represents your "HOME" directory) and deleting the line that says:<br>
<code>
languages=cxx tcl verilog vhdl XML PSL
</code></li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Attempting to traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an instance or a scope will result in a crash.</li>
<li>
There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.
</ul></li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
vlog will now print an "unsupported" error message for nested design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3.  This error may be suppressed using the <b>-suppress 2230</b> command-line options.</li>
<li>
DU/View named with an extended identifier is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3h</b>
<ul>
<li>
Gameplan format updates for XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb):
<ul><li>The LINK field must now be specified as a seperate attribute (ie: ATTR_VAL element). The NAME of the coverage item is no longer used as the link string.</li>
    <li>A list of user-defined attributes is now specified in the stylesheet (and can be edited by the user). Gameplan attributes recognized by xml2ucdb or included in the stylesheet list are imported as testplan attribute fields.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
Excel format XML Testplan Import updates:
<ul><li>Blank cells originally optimized away in Excel's XML output are restored as the testplan file is read. This means that the data in an Excel-based testplan no longer has to be given a non-default color or style in order to import correctly.</li></ul></li>
<li>
Change in XML Testplan Import (xml2ucdb) behavior: In autonumber mode (ie: MsWord, Frame, etc), a data field (ie: paragraph) which does not start with a recognized keyword from the "datalabels" list would be assumed to be a continuation of the last recognized data field. This now only happens if said paragraph does not start with a "keyword-like" token (alphanumeric token followed by a colon, ignoring any leading whitespace). This is to prevent data fields with misspelled or undeclared tokens from being assigned the wrong significance in the UCDB file.</li>
<li>
SDF annotation of RECREM or SETUPHOLD matching only a single setup/hold/recovery/removal timing check will result in a warning message.</li>
<li>
The +acc switch of vopt has been enhanced to accept a 'q' specifier, which enables access to VHDL variables and generics.</li>
<li>
If you use the GUI virtual signal/function command with "-install /", 
the signal will no longer be installed at the real context tree root, in
which case it may be inaccessible, and certainly not observable in the
objects window, but will now be installed in the top context of the first
top-level design unit. </li>
<li>
Nested XML testplan import (importing one testplan from inside another testplan) has been enhanced to support cross-format nesting. Previous issues with nesting an auto-numbered testplan inside an explicit-numbered testplan have been resolved. In particular, the following limitations are lifted:
<ul>
<li>Parameter inheritance now works correctly.</li>
<li>An explicit-numbered child testplan no longer has to be numbered to match the parent section.</li>
<li>Auto-numbered child testplans will now be numbered to match their parent section.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>
XML Testplan Import: The behavior of the "-title" and "-tagprefix" options has been clarified in light of the nested testplan enhancement:
<ul><li>For the top-most testplan, if "-title" is not set, the basename of the input XML file is used.</li>
    <li>For the top-most testplan, if "-tagprefix" is not set, the "-title" value is used.</li>
    <li>For nested testplans, neither option has a default (ie: if not set, they remain unset).</li></ul>
Local (child) tags are only generated if the "-tagprefix" is set for the child testplan in question.
</li>
<li>
HTML Coverage Report: The "Coverage by Linked Item" table (on testplan scope summary page) has been significantly enhanced. The instance column now indicates the enclosing HDL scope for branch, condition, and expression coverage; the string in that column is a link pointing to the detailed coverage information for that item; and a column containing the filename and line number of the coverage item has been added.
</li>
<li>
The HTML coverage report has been enhanced to supress the coverage summary page for scopes which have no coverage (either because the source was not instrumented or was later excluded). In most cases, the scope will remain in the navigation tree but will be grayed-out (and not linked to a coverage summary page). In the design tree, if a scope and all it's children have no coverage, the children are dropped from the tree (testplan scopes are never dropped).
</li>
<li>
There have been some changes to the learn flow. Some performance issues have been addressed, including reducing the information learned during an SDF back-annotation phase.</li>
<li>
File locking for UCDB merge:
<br>
We support a cumulative merge (vcover merge out.ucdb out.ucdb in.ucdb). Such merge requests may occur simultaneously from various platforms in a networking environment. In order to avoid corrupting cumulative coverage results, merges of UCDB files are serialized. "out.ucdb" is only written by a single process at a time. 
<ul>
<li>Creation of lock files whose purpose is to signal by their presence that a UCDB is locked for writing. 
<li>Operations are atomic. When creating the lock file, the process verifies that it does not exist and then creates it, but without allowing another process the opportunity to create it in the meantime. 
<li>The lock is advisory. Processes which intend to modify a UCDB file, by convention, check for locks to coordinate access to that file. The system fails if this convention is ignored. 
<li>There is a back-up file mechanism within vcover <b>merge</b> that, when optioned for, saves a back-up of the merge output before merging and can, when optioned for, automatically restore the back-up in case another process has its lock broken. 
<li>When blocked on a lock: 
<ul>
<li>We print out "Waiting for lock..." messages every so often and let the user explicitly break the lock if they think it safe. 
<li>We produce a message similar to: "User Bilbo on machine Frodo has had the lock for 16 days". 
<li>Retry attempts will occur every 10 seconds. 
<li>Blocked messages will repeat about every 3 minutes.
</ul>
<li>The lock is released after a time-out period: 
<ul>
<li>This cannot inadvertently time-out. 
Cannot be broken if a process is starved simply because others get in first. 
Time-out is only for the case where a single process takes too long. 
<li>The time-out period is user-configurable. 
<li>When a time-out condition occurs, the process timing out will be sent a "kill" signal. 
</ul>
</ul></li>
<li>
The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro body through the macro substitution process.
</li>
<li>
The vsim '-assertfile <file>' switch now only applies to assertion (VHDL/SVA/PSL) messages issued by the tool.  Use the vsim '-errorfile <file>' switch to redirect non-assertion tool messages into the specified file. To retain the tool’s previous behavior, set the environment variable MTI_ASSERTFILE_COMPATIBILITY to any value. This environment variable may eventually be deprecated.

In the modelsim.ini file, all “AssertionFormat” variables have been renamed as “MessageFormat” variables. The MessageFormat variables are valid for both assertion and non-assertion tool messages, as before.  For backward compatibility the AssertionFormat variables will continue to be supported.
</li>
<li>
The <b>restart</b> command will reload the current dataset if the current dataset is not the active simulation ("sim"), in effect acting just like a restart of a simulation.  See the <b>dataset restart</b> command below under "New Features".</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below the product directory.</li>
<li>
The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see <b>vcover report -html</b>).</li>
<li>
Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted.  For example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)" and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.  The conditions under which
name permutation could occur are based on internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly correlated to source descriptions.
</li>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
<br>...
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.
</li>
<li>
Version 6.3d includes the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.
<br>
<br>
Improvements to the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System include the following:
<br>
Search changes -- Improved search time, multiple keyword support, search ranking icons, results filtering by book or topic, and improved accuracy of results.
<br>
Search and content scopes -- A new “My Search Scope” option lets you define a custom set of books to search.
<br>
Global index improvements -- improved viewing speed and collapse/uncollapse of "like" terms.
<br>
Getting Started movie -- provides an overview of all the features of the InfoHub and Mentor Graphic Documentation System. You can view the Getting Started (Movie) from the Quick Tips menu located in the lower left-hand corner of the InfoHub.
<br>
Font size -- increase or decrease the default size of the font by using the new triple "A" icon in the header.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving vopt the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.
</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line
  <ol>
  <li>Added a <b>-verbose</b> option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A <b>-ucdbfilename &lt;file&gt;</b> option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any <b>-format &lt;format&gt;</b> option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The <b>-tagseparators &lt;chars&gt;</b> option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
<li>
If the PATH column value is set to "-" it will be ignored (this is useful for the PATH-per-LINK case where one of the LINK values doesn't need a PATH).
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a "Path" column to direct testplan link item matching to a specific region of the design. In addition, a path may be prepended onto any CoverGroup, CoverPoint or Cross link item.<br>
For CoverPoint, CoverGroup, and Cross link items:<ul>
<li>If the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path information will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option to the tag command and the trailing component of the Link column will be parsed as usual and used to match the cover item. Any path added to the string in the Link column will be ignored.</li>
<li>If the Path column is not used or is left blank, and a path is prepended onto the string in the Link column, the prepended path will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option on the tag command.</li></ul>
For CoverItem, Assertion, or Directive link items:<ul>
<li>If the string in the Link column starts with a path separator character, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option in the tag command and no other tag command option is used.</li>
<li>If the string in the Link column does not start with a path separator (in other words, is not a full path), and the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option and the Link strung is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command and no path is specified.</li></ul>
For all other link item types, the contents of the Path column are ignored.
Note: If the Path column for a given link item is the literal string "-", the Path column is ignored for that link item only.
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports test data record tagging. If the Type column for a given link item is "Test", the contents of the Link column will be used as the value of the <b>-testrecord</b> option on the tag command associated with that link item.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a <b>-stylesheet &lt;file&gt;</b> option ("stylesheet=<file>" in the INI file). This option points to an XSL transformation stylesheet which is applied to the imported XML file prior to extraction.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports XML files generated by Jasper's GamePlan testplan utility. Use the <b>-format GamePlan</b> option. </li>
<li>
Use of the "analog" format within the Wave window has been made easier by adding support for the use of <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> to control waveform scaling (the old method required use of "offset" and "scale").</li>
<li>
<h>Font Changes</h><br>
The way fonts are used and configured in the product has changed.  There are now 5 configurable fonts in the product: menuFont, textFont, fixedFont, treeFont, and footerFont.  These fonts are used by all windows and are customer configurable using the Edit Preferences dialog box.  The previous method of configuring fonts is no longer used and the preference variables will be ignored.  The Source window will continue to use it's own font setting as that window shares the font preferences with other products that use the DesignPad text editor.<br>
For current customers upgrading to 6.3b and later releases that have set up customized font preferences, these preferences will have to be manually configured for the new fonts, otherwise the product will look and behave just the same.</li>
<li>
A change to licensing  for this release eliminates extraneous entries in the license server log file that were the result of an availability check for a license feature.    There used to be a license checkout  line (i.e., OUT) followed by a license checkin line (i.e., IN) with 0 time duration each time the application checked on the availability of a license to decide whether to attempt the actual checkout of the license. </li>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GB.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default &lt;size&gt; unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either KB, MB or GB specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code>
vcd limit 6GB<br>
</code>

or<br>

<code>
vcd limit 400MB
</code></li>
<li>
Taglists (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command can now be used to modify local variables in Verilog tasks and functions.</li>
<li>
The profile UI has been modified in the following ways:
<br>- A new pane named "Design Units" has been added to the profile window.  It aggregrates results on a per design unit basis.
<br>- "sum(Mem in)" and "sum(Mem in(%))" columns have been added to the Ranked and Design Units profile panes.  These columns report cumulative values for memory in and memory in %, providing another metric to use when examining memory profile results.
<br>- Memory values are displayed in the profile windows as comma separated numbers rather than with K and M suffixes.  This provides correspondence between
the printed size of the number and its actual value; the goal is to make the data easier to read.

</li>
<li>
When encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the encrypted Verilog file.</li>
<li>
When the "tagprefix" is not explicitly specified, the testplan "title" is used. If this title string contains whitespace, the whitespace is now replaced with underscore characters for use in tag strings.</li>
