   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * The OK button in the Merge Dialog of Verification Management Browser was
       not responsive to Instance and design unit entries.
     * When running in post-simulation mode, adding items to the Dataflow
       window  using  the  popup  menu in the Objects window did not work
       correctly.
     * When using analog formatting and viewing the waveform's "min/max" values
       in either the Wave Properties dialog or the Format > Analog (Custom)
       dialog, it was possible for the displayed values to appear to have
       rounding inprecision. For example a value of "13.0" might be displayed
       as "12.999999999999998". This has been fixed so the displayed values
       will match however they would appear in the Wave's "Value" pane.
     * The first paste within a source file would not result in the SAVE action
       becoming enabled. This has been fixed.
     * The Force and Change picks in the Objects window popup menu sometimes
       had incorrect enable/disable state for System Verilog design items.
     * The  balloon help in the Wave window Messages pane did not work as
       expected for high zoom-in levels.
     * Using the "Rescale to fit Y data" or "Show menu of other actions->View
       Min Y" or "Show menu of other actions->View Max Y" menu picks from the
       Analog sidebar menu would result in a Tcl stacktrace if there were gaps
       in the logged data (i.e., intervals of No_Data).
     * The nolog command with a wildcard would cause a crash when it tried to
       stop logging on signals that had not been logged.
     * The nolog -all command would prevent updates on some array signals.
     * Logging VHDL variable and generics which were NULL arrays could produce
       a WLF file that would cause a crash when read post-simulation with vsim
       -view or dataset open.
     * The -sdftyp option failed to load design if the specified path has
       extended identifier.
     * Dataflow operations using certain mixed-language designs could cause
       vsim to crash.
     * Packed System Verilog multi-dimensional arrays could not be expanded in
       the Wave window.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * Continuous assignments to a slice of a variable inside a generate loop,
       where the slice was bound by the generate variable, would not set the
       correct bits of the variable.
     * vlog  sometimes caused an "Unexpected signal: 11" when reading and
       writing to a bit-select of a member of a structure inside always_comb.
     * A Warning is now issued for specification of an array as 'randc' (cyclic
       random). The 'randc' modifier is not supported for arrays (or queues).
       The solver treats these variables as 'rand' (random without the cyclic
       characteristic). Previously the solver was silent about treating 'randc'
       arrays as simply 'rand'. The 'randc' modifier for arrays is supported in
       the 6.4 release.
     * Calling a super class constructor inside a member function of a derived
       class might have given errors like:
       ** Error: 1.v(8): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vrslvdecl.c(6082)
       stmt
       ** Error: 1.v(8): Verilog Compiler exiting
     * Usage of non-simple delay expressions in an event triggering statement,
       such as in:
       ->> #(delay_a - delay_b) ev;
       might have resulted in an "Unexpected Signal 11".
     * Array Locator Methods, unique() & unique_index() have been updated as
       per mantis item 978.
       unique() called on an array will now return a queue, consisting of one
       and only one entry for each of the values found in the array.
       Similarly, unique_index() returns indices of all elements with unique
       values  or whose expression evaluates to a unique value. The queue
       returned contains one and only one entry for each of the values found in
       the array.
       For example for an array A = '{1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 6, 9, 2, 6, 9}
       # A.unique() is '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
       # A.unique_index() is '{0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 2, 9}
     * Interface  and  program design elements were not allowing defparam
       statements within their bodies.
     * The Verilog compiler crashed with very large floating point values, such
       as 1.7976931348623157e+308, given as a parameter.
     * System  Verilog designs with user packages named "avm_pkg" did not
       correctly refresh.
     * Constant functions that contained references to parameters or other
       constant functions sometimes caused vsim to crash during elaboration.
     * Instantiation of a VHDL design unit from within a Verilog generate block
       could fail if the design unit contains scalar generics whose values are
       inferred by vopt. The simulator will erroneously produce the following
       error message:
** Error: (vsim-3171) Could not find machine code for '...'
     * System Verilog "foreach" when used to iterate over an array which has
       its dimensions defined as an unsigned integer might have given wrong
       results in incremental compile mode.
     * Declaring a parameter internal to a non-parameterized class (for example
       "class C; parameter SIZE=32; endclass") caused an elaboration crash.
     * Functions  declared  in modports could not be declared to have ref
       arguments. The compile issues a error stating the function must be
       automatic or the keyword automatic is not allowed.
     * Using a dynamic array of named-events inside a class caused vsim to
       crash.
     * Usage of a non-simple slice width for a streaming concat, such as:
       { << foo() {d} }; might have given an internal error like:
       ** Error: bug.v(11): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vfold.c(1746)
     * Under some conditions, if two always blocks had the same sensitivity
       list and contained if statements, optimization could incorrect optimize
       away the body of one if statement.
     * Using a part-select of an unpacked array as part of the streaming concat
       expression on the LHS would sometimes result in a vsim crash.
     * $size when called on an array of parameterized class objects would
       result in this internal error:
       Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgentd.c(339)
     * Dereferencing an element of a class through a virtual interface (i.e.,
       "vif.clshandle.var") would result in the error message:
       Illegal virtual interface dereference.
     * Issue in Verilog incomplete pragma is fixed.
     * Expressions having a mix of "real" and "reg" types produced incorrect
       results in some cases.
     * Errors would be reported by the simulator when attempting to perform
       restart on designs with configurations. In incremental (novopt) mode, a
       stacktrace  would  often occur. In vopt mode, when vopt is invoked
       automatically by the simulator (2-step flow), the simulator would report
       the following error:
** Error: (vsim-8345) Unable to find original top-level design units for optimi
zed design "_opt".
     * vopt would sometimes report errors as being in protected code when they
       were actually in public, non-encrypted code.
     * SystemVerilog package compilation was not respecting -Lf library path
       directives.
     * Simulations using pulse_e_style_ondetect could hang.
     * With -G and +acc=r specified at the same time in vopt, an error message
       was displayed some times like:
       Invalid override of parameter 'P' whose value may no longer be modified.
     * Within some contexts such as a parameterized class, an invalid error
       could be reported when assigning a enum value to an array of the enum
       type.
     * In some cases, optimizations would incorrectly apply forces when nets
       were connected via interface ports.
     * In  some  complex assignments to multibit registers where distinct
       processes were sensitive to different bits of the reg, it was possible
       that a fatal error could be encountered during simulation.
     * The vlog compiler crashed if a time literal (like "1ns") was used as a
       default task or function argument value and the task or function was
       declared in a package or $unit scope without a specified time precision.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.3h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * An indexed name formed with a prefix of a type originally declared as an
       incomplete type and later fully defined as an array type would sometimes
       crash the vcom compiler.
     * In some cases, vopt could infer incorrect values for generics, or infer
       none, when configurations specified bindings of distinct architectures
       of a single entity. If no generic values were inferred, and the entity
       specified no default value, the following error message would be issued:
       ** Fatal: (vsim-3350) Generic '...' has not been given a value.
     * In some case a VHDL design would crash during elaboration if a process
       contained signal assignments where the longest static prefix of the
       target was out of bounds.
     * In some cases, a std_logic_vector passed to an element of an array of
       std_logic_vectors would fail with an error message about a mismatch.
     * If a subprogram was declared within a process declaration region and the
       subprogram was inlined the compile time or vopt time grew rapidly base
       on the number of times the subprogram was used. The time could get so
       bad that the compilation or optimization would not complete.
     * In some instances when a signal array appeared twice in a port map one
       of them was left unconnected.
     * For some cases where name of block generic is similar to the generic of
       parent entity, wrong generic propagation was taking place.
     * An expanded name whose prefix was one of the packages in one of the
       libraries shipped with the product could not be used in a user-defined
       package of the same name. For example, a user-defined package named
       "numeric_std",     if    it    contained    an    expanded    name
       "ieee.numeric_std.signed", even though legal, would cause the compiler
       error:
       Expanded name prefix cannot denote design unit being analyzed.
     * In some cases when doing default binding at elaboration, if multiple
       entities with the same name existed in more than one library the default
       entity was taken from the wrong library.
     * In some cases, an optimization prevented rows of a two dimensional array
       from being assigned with up to date values of a local variable.
     * vcom was resulting in the corruption of _parsed.vhd file in refresh
       mode.
     * If multiple logical libraries are mapped to the same physical library
       and a configuration configures a design unit in that physical library,
       an optimized design may have crashed when loaded or during runtime. This
       occurred when the design unit could be referenced via multiple logical
       library names and the optimization information was only found via one of
       those library names.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.3h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.3h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * Fixed scparse compile errors on Windows when variables are named "OUT",
       "IN" or "OPTIONAL".
     * Creating global time based objects like sc_time or sc_clock would lead
       to error in setting time resolution. This will not lead to an error as
       long as the default time resolution of "1 ns" is used.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.3h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * Verilog single-bit vectors could not be connected to VHDL bit/std_logic,
       when binding to VHDL target scopes. This has been fixed.
     * Verilog hierarchical references starting from module name were not
       getting resolved, when binding to VHDL target scopes using SystemVerilog
       bind construct.
     * The vcd dumpports command failed to capture "same state" contention in
       the VCD file on an inout port in the case of a Verilog DUT underneath a
       VHDL  testbench. Specifically, transitions from one driver "on" to
       multiple drivers "on" without a state change were not recorded.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * The XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb) will now display warnings for
       either of the following conditions:
          + If no testplan scopes resulted from the import, or
          + If no testplan scopes contained design coverage point links.
       Note  that  the xml2ucdb utility cannot verify the accuracy of the
       coverage point links -- only whether links were or were not specified in
       the testplan.
     * The XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb) will now ignore leading
       whitespace in potential data fields when looking for field labels (ie:
       "WEIGHT:", "GOAL:", etc).
     * In some cases, the "Show Covered" and "Show Missing" buttons on the
       branch and condition detailed coverage pages would not show *all* the
       covered/missing coverage items.
     * Fixed a bug in which generate blocks are not reported for code coverage
       after restart, in no-vopt mode.
     * Missed Coverage window displayed excluded FSM states and transitions in
       live simulation mode.
     * Fixed a problem in which VHDL generate blocks in vopt would not show
       code coverage data.
     * Fixed a problem in which a crash would occur if a VHDL architecture was
       compiled with code coverage on, and the configuration was compiled
       without code coverage on.
     * Having the VHDL clocked flip/flop "clkOpt" optimization enabled when
       code coverage is on has caused a great deal of confusion among users.
       With this optimization, processes that implement an edge-triggered
       register with reset are optimized so that the processes are invoked only
       on the correct edge of the clock, or reset. This causes branch coverage
       to record zero counts for the other edge of the clock, which has caused
       a great deal of confusion. Consequently, we now disable the clkOpt
       optimization when CoverOpt is less than 4 (the default is 3). Turning
       off this optimization does slow down simulation. If you still want
       clkOpt enabled, use CoverOpt = 4.
     * A performance problem has been fixed with code coverage when there are
       large numbers of toggles.
     * When VHDL with VITAL cells is compiled in Vopt flow with FSM coverage
       turned on, Vsim sometimes crashes during elaboration with following
       error:
       ** Fatal: Internal error: ../../../src/vsim/cover.c (4070)
       It is fixed now.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.3h
     * Creating a mapping with uppercase WORK can cause the following error
       after optimizing:
       # ** Warning: (vsim-56) Problem with optimized design dependency file
       "/u/project/mlibs/MTB/_opt/_deps" - file is corrupted.
     * In some cases, the color in the Wave window of a composite bus would
       display as red (implying an unknown member value) when all member values
       were known values.
     * The vsim -msgmode WLF option incorrectly suppressed elaboration error
       messages which should have been reported in the transcript.
     * When  -gen_xml was used with vcom or vlog, the _info file could be
       modified.

   Known Defects in 6.3h
     * Syntax highlighting may not function properly in the Source window (all
       the source is shown as plain text). You can fix this problem by editing
       ~/hte/v2_38/hte.ini (where ~ represents your "HOME" directory) and
       deleting the line that says:
       languages=cxx tcl verilog vhdl XML PSL
     * The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in
       behavior compared to the vsim mode version. In the viewcov mode version,
       clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the
       coverage data for that design unit, itself. Also, if you clear coverage
       data  in  a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not
       affected by that operation. In vsim mode, the data is more tightly
       linked such that one operation affects the other. In viewcov mode, if
       you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design
       units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
       on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an add
       wave command, when the working directory was created under an older
       32-bit Linux OS.
       This  is  a  Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
       simulator.
       A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator with
       command line option -wlfnolock.
     * Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and
       memory  profiling at the same time. Memory profiling requires much
       overhead  process,  and it can skew the results of the performance
       profiling data.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on
       consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.
     * Attempting  to  traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an
       instance or a scope will result in a crash.
     * There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
          + Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
          + Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and
            viewcov mode.
     * Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog
       clocking blocks.
     * On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs
       during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal,
       and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting
       with proper error status.
     * vlog  will  now  print  an  "unsupported" error message for nested
       design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3. This error
       may be suppressed using the -suppress 2230 command-line options.
     * DU/View named with an extended identifier is not supported.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.3h
     * Gameplan format updates for XML Testplan Import utility (xml2ucdb):
          + The LINK field must now be specified as a seperate attribute (ie:
            ATTR_VAL element). The NAME of the coverage item is no longer used
            as the link string.
          + A  list  of  user-defined  attributes is now specified in the
            stylesheet (and can be edited by the user). Gameplan attributes
            recognized by xml2ucdb or included in the stylesheet list are
            imported as testplan attribute fields.
     * Excel format XML Testplan Import updates:
          + Blank cells originally optimized away in Excel's XML output are
            restored as the testplan file is read. This means that the data in
            an Excel-based testplan no longer has to be given a non-default
            color or style in order to import correctly.
     * Change in XML Testplan Import (xml2ucdb) behavior: In autonumber mode
       (ie: MsWord, Frame, etc), a data field (ie: paragraph) which does not
       start with a recognized keyword from the "datalabels" list would be
       assumed to be a continuation of the last recognized data field. This now
       only happens if said paragraph does not start with a "keyword-like"
       token (alphanumeric token followed by a colon, ignoring any leading
       whitespace).  This  is  to  prevent data fields with misspelled or
       undeclared tokens from being assigned the wrong significance in the UCDB
       file.
     * SDF  annotation  of  RECREM  or  SETUPHOLD  matching only a single
       setup/hold/recovery/removal  timing check will result in a warning
       message.
     * The +acc switch of vopt has been enhanced to accept a 'q' specifier,
       which enables access to VHDL variables and generics.
     * If you use the GUI virtual signal/function command with "-install /",
       the signal will no longer be installed at the real context tree root, in
       which case it may be inaccessible, and certainly not observable in the
       objects window, but will now be installed in the top context of the
       first top-level design unit.
     * Nested XML testplan import (importing one testplan from inside another
       testplan) has been enhanced to support cross-format nesting. Previous
       issues   with   nesting   an   auto-numbered  testplan  inside  an
       explicit-numbered  testplan have been resolved. In particular, the
       following limitations are lifted:
          + Parameter inheritance now works correctly.
          + An explicit-numbered child testplan no longer has to be numbered to
            match the parent section.
          + Auto-numbered child testplans will now be numbered to match their
            parent section.
     * XML Testplan Import: The behavior of the "-title" and "-tagprefix"
       options has been clarified in light of the nested testplan enhancement:
          + For the top-most testplan, if "-title" is not set, the basename of
            the input XML file is used.
          + For the top-most testplan, if "-tagprefix" is not set, the "-title"
            value is used.
          + For nested testplans, neither option has a default (ie: if not set,
            they remain unset).
       Local (child) tags are only generated if the "-tagprefix" is set for the
       child testplan in question.
     * HTML Coverage Report: The "Coverage by Linked Item" table (on testplan
       scope summary page) has been significantly enhanced. The instance column
       now  indicates  the enclosing HDL scope for branch, condition, and
       expression coverage; the string in that column is a link pointing to the
       detailed coverage information for that item; and a column containing the
       filename and line number of the coverage item has been added.
     * The HTML coverage report has been enhanced to supress the coverage
       summary page for scopes which have no coverage (either because the
       source was not instrumented or was later excluded). In most cases, the
       scope will remain in the navigation tree but will be grayed-out (and not
       linked to a coverage summary page). In the design tree, if a scope and
       all it's children have no coverage, the children are dropped from the
       tree (testplan scopes are never dropped).
     * There have been some changes to the learn flow. Some performance issues
       have been addressed, including reducing the information learned during
       an SDF back-annotation phase.
     * File locking for UCDB merge:
       We support a cumulative merge (vcover merge out.ucdb out.ucdb in.ucdb).
       Such merge requests may occur simultaneously from various platforms in a
       networking environment. In order to avoid corrupting cumulative coverage
       results, merges of UCDB files are serialized. "out.ucdb" is only written
       by a single process at a time.
          + Creation of lock files whose purpose is to signal by their presence
            that a UCDB is locked for writing.
          + Operations are atomic. When creating the lock file, the process
            verifies that it does not exist and then creates it, but without
            allowing  another process the opportunity to create it in the
            meantime.
          + The lock is advisory. Processes which intend to modify a UCDB file,
            by convention, check for locks to coordinate access to that file.
            The system fails if this convention is ignored.
          + There is a back-up file mechanism within vcover merge that, when
            optioned for, saves a back-up of the merge output before merging
            and can, when optioned for, automatically restore the back-up in
            case another process has its lock broken.
          + When blocked on a lock:
               o We print out "Waiting for lock..." messages every so often and
                 let the user explicitly break the lock if they think it safe.
               o We produce a message similar to: "User Bilbo on machine Frodo
                 has had the lock for 16 days".
               o Retry attempts will occur every 10 seconds.
               o Blocked messages will repeat about every 3 minutes.
          + The lock is released after a time-out period:
               o This cannot inadvertently time-out. Cannot be broken if a
                 process  is  starved simply because others get in first.
                 Time-out is only for the case where a single process takes too
                 long.
               o The time-out period is user-configurable.
               o When a time-out condition occurs, the process timing out will
                 be sent a "kill" signal.
     * The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro
       body through the macro substitution process.
     * The  vsim  '-assertfile  '  switch  now  only applies to assertion
       (VHDL/SVA/PSL) messages issued by the tool. Use the vsim '-errorfile '
       switch to redirect non-assertion tool messages into the specified file.
       To retain the tools previous behavior, set the environment variable
       MTI_ASSERTFILE_COMPATIBILITY to any value. This environment variable may
       eventually be deprecated. In the modelsim.ini file, all AssertionFormat
       variables  have  been  renamed  as  MessageFormat  variables.  The
       MessageFormat variables are valid for both assertion and non-assertion
       tool messages, as before. For backward compatibility the AssertionFormat
       variables will continue to be supported.
     * The restart command will reload the current dataset if the current
       dataset is not the active simulation ("sim"), in effect acting just like
       a restart of a simulation. See the dataset restart command below under
       "New Features".
     * The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved
       from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below
       the product directory.
     * The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report
       functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see vcover report
       -html).
     * Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated
       names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted. For
       example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)"
       and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.
       The conditions under which name permutation could occur are based on
       internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly
       correlated to source descriptions.
     * The default action for the command onbreak has changed from "pause" to
       "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain
       any onbreak commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop
       executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of
       the macro file. The resume command continues the execution of the macro
       file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default
       value will affect macro files without an onbreak command so that those
       files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old
       behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command
       onbreak pause at the beginning of the macro file.
     * The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the vcd dumpports command
       has changed from not collapsed to collapsed. The specific change was to
       the line in the modelsim.ini file: "DumpportsCollapse = 0".
       For 6.3, this was changed to: "DumpportsCollapse = 1".
       To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in
       the modelsim.ini file.
     * Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment
       patterns'. Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and
       produced the following warning:
       You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
       Now we will print errors, as in the following example:
       int a[3:0] = {default:0};
       int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
       ...
       ** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
       ** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
       ** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
       ** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
     * Previously,  an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed
       nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and
       dynamic  arrays)  did produce output. In 6.3, we will now print an
       elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).
       This error may be suppressed.
       To  print  unpacked  data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format
       specifiers.  The  former  prints  the  data in the form of a legal
       "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.
     * Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach
       array.
     * The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.
       With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation
       unit items. An example of such of reference is the following small
       design:
            typedef int T;
            package p;
                T foo;
            endpackage
       Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations
       that packages need should be refactored into separate packages. For
       example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the
       following:
            package shared_types;
                typedef int T;
            endpackage
            package p;
                import shared_types::*;
                T foo;
            endpackage
       It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before
       a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into
       the subsequent package. With the new rules, the package references may
       not look into such an import. For example, the following approach will
       no longer work:
            package shared_types;
                typedef int T;
            endpackage
            import shared_types::*;
            package p;
                T foo; // cannot refer to T since it is imported into
                // the compilation unit, not into the package
            endpackage
       The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored so that
       packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.
     * Version 6.3d includes the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System,
       which includes the following components:
       InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your
       locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search
       interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed
       documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search
       directly  to  SupportNet.  The InfoHub provides access to User and
       Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats,
       and Release Notes, delivered in text format.
       PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation
       if you cannot use an HTML browser.
       Improvements to the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System include
       the following:
       Search changes -- Improved search time, multiple keyword support, search
       ranking icons, results filtering by book or topic, and improved accuracy
       of results.
       Search and content scopes -- A new My Search Scope option lets you
       define a custom set of books to search.
       Global   index   improvements   --   improved  viewing  speed  and
       collapse/uncollapse of "like" terms.
       Getting Started movie -- provides an overview of all the features of the
       InfoHub  and Mentor Graphic Documentation System. You can view the
       Getting Started (Movie) from the Quick Tips menu located in the lower
       left-hand corner of the InfoHub.
       Font size -- increase or decrease the default size of the font by using
       the new triple "A" icon in the header.
     * The  vopt  +acc=g option has been replaced by the +floatparameters
       option(Verilog designs) and the +floatgenerics option (VHDL designs).
       Both +floatparameters and +floatgenerics accept the same [+<module>][.]
       syntax accepted by +acc. Use +floatparameters and +floatgenerics to
       instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during
       optimization. The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and
       thus  capable  of accepting modified values via the vsim -g and -G
       options. +floatparameters and +floatgenerics may have adverse effects on
       performance in some cases.
     * The vopt +acc=m option has been changed such that it no longer preserves
       primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the
       new +acc=u option.
     * The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini
       file. vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt
       modelsim.ini file variable and the -cover command line option.
     * The  -coverage  option  to  vopt  is  no  longer needed. vopt will
       automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with
       a -cover option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if
       you give a -cover xyz option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any
       -cover abc option given to an individual source file when processing
       that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with
       coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving vopt the -nocover
       option. This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt
       time instead of having to recompile individual source files.
     * The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items
       inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('/') was
       used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('::').
     * The recording of attributes for transactions has changed. Previously,
       any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
       transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions and
       the transactions on their substreams as well.
       Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
       transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
       to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
       Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
       substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
       will be no difference due to this change.
     * Changes for coverage exclude command:
          + Replace the option -instance with -scope to accommodate more scope
            types like generate block.
          + Transition  names are used with the option -ftrans instead of
            transition id's. The new syntax is:
                [-ftrans <state_var_name><transition_name>+ | all]
            where transition_name is specified as <state_name>-> <state_name>.
          + State names are used with the option -fstate instead of state id's.
            The new syntax is:
                [-fstate <state_var_name> <state_name>+ | all]
          + A new option -else is added to exclude the else part of every
            if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number
            for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
          + Recursive  exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively
            exclude a scope, -scope is specified together with -r.
          + -scope and -du are supported with -togglenode.
     * The  UCDB  bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to
       'if_branch'.
     * The  simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog
       escaped  identifier  syntax  for  all Verilog escaped identifiers.
       Previously  such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended
       identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool
       output and CLI commands.
       Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the
       simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.
       Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might
       refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers
       in the same fullpath. For example:
       /top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom
       top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom
       (depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')
       Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim
       command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be
       composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language
       kind.
       A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control
       parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is
       set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of
       either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with
       older  do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier
       syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.
       Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy
       function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".
       On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be
       used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the
       command  line  will  work  in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This
       limitation may be removed in a future release.
     * If  an  invalid  end  time  is specified when recording the end of
       transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time
       is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start
       time.
     * The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed
       for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not
       backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt
       to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result
       in an error similar to the following:
       ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work".
       (Format: 3).
       Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove
       the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back
       to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the
       6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3
       releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2
       version using the -format option. For example:
       vlib -format 1 work
       The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version
       for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the
       -archive option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib -format
       option.
     * The  XML  Testplan  Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the
       command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency.
       The following changes were made:
         1. Command-line
              1. Added a -verbose option to show testplan hierarchy and design
                 mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than
                 before.
              2. A -ucdbfilename <file> option has been added to remove the
                 order-dependence  of  the files on the command line (the
                 original syntax is still accepted).
              3. The command-line arguments are now order-independent.
              4. Any -format <format> option found on the command line is
                 processed first and other extraction parameters found on the
                 command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found
                 in the configuration file.
              5. The same parameter names are used both on the command line and
                 in the configuration file.
              6. The  -tagseparators  <chars>  option,  when  used on the
                 command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified
                 on the command line (see below).
         2. Configuration file
              1. Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded
                 data labels.
              2. The following parameters have been re-named for consistency.
                 In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
                   1. start => starttags
                   2. stop => stoptags
                   3. exclude => excludetags
                   4. description => descriptiontag
                   5. sectionitem => sectiontags
                   6. dataitem => datatags
                   7. testitem => titletag
                   8. coveritem => linktag
                   9. coverattr => linkattr
              3. The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels"
                 parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still
                 recognized.
         3. Behavior
              1. The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items
                 now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended.
                 Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.
              2. The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section
                 number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).
              3. Data  capture is no longer enabled from the start of the
                 document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags"
                 or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is
                 required to enable data capture.
     * If the PATH column value is set to "-" it will be ignored (this is
       useful for the PATH-per-LINK case where one of the LINK values doesn't
       need a PATH).
     * XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a "Path" column to direct testplan
       link item matching to a specific region of the design. In addition, a
       path may be prepended onto any CoverGroup, CoverPoint or Cross link
       item.
       For CoverPoint, CoverGroup, and Cross link items:
          + If  the  contents  of the Path column are non-blank, the Path
            information will be used as the value of the -path option to the
            tag command and the trailing component of the Link column will be
            parsed as usual and used to match the cover item. Any path added to
            the string in the Link column will be ignored.
          + If the Path column is not used or is left blank, and a path is
            prepended onto the string in the Link column, the prepended path
            will be used as the value of the -path option on the tag command.
       For CoverItem, Assertion, or Directive link items:
          + If the string in the Link column starts with a path separator
            character, the Link string is used as the value of the -path option
            in the tag command and no other tag command option is used.
          + If  the  string in the Link column does not start with a path
            separator (in other words, is not a full path), and the contents of
            the Path column are non-blank, the Path string is used as the value
            of the -path option and the Link strung is used as the value of the
            -match option on the tag command.
          + Otherwise, the Link string is used as the value of the -match
            option on the tag command and no path is specified.
       For all other link item types, the contents of the Path column are
       ignored. Note: If the Path column for a given link item is the literal
       string "-", the Path column is ignored for that link item only.
     * XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports test data record tagging. If the Type
       column for a given link item is "Test", the contents of the Link column
       will be used as the value of the -testrecord option on the tag command
       associated with that link item.
     * XML  Import  (xml2ucdb)  now  supports a -stylesheet <file> option
       ("stylesheet="  in  the  INI  file).  This option points to an XSL
       transformation stylesheet which is applied to the imported XML file
       prior to extraction.
     * XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports XML files generated by Jasper's
       GamePlan testplan utility. Use the -format GamePlan option.
     * Use of the "analog" format within the Wave window has been made easier
       by adding support for the use of -min and -max to control waveform
       scaling (the old method required use of "offset" and "scale").
     * Font Changes
       The way fonts are used and configured in the product has changed. There
       are  now  5 configurable fonts in the product: menuFont, textFont,
       fixedFont, treeFont, and footerFont. These fonts are used by all windows
       and are customer configurable using the Edit Preferences dialog box. The
       previous  method  of  configuring  fonts is no longer used and the
       preference variables will be ignored. The Source window will continue to
       use it's own font setting as that window shares the font preferences
       with other products that use the DesignPad text editor.
       For current customers upgrading to 6.3b and later releases that have set
       up  customized font preferences, these preferences will have to be
       manually configured for the new fonts, otherwise the product will look
       and behave just the same.
     * A change to licensing for this release eliminates extraneous entries in
       the license server log file that were the result of an availability
       check for a license feature. There used to be a license checkout line
       (i.e., OUT) followed by a license checkin line (i.e., IN) with 0 time
       duration each time the application checked on the availability of a
       license to decide whether to attempt the actual checkout of the license.
     * The vcd limit <size> command has been changed adding support for a file
       size limit greater than 2 GB. The size argument now excepts a unit
       specifier. The default <size> unit remains as bytes. An optional suffix
       of either KB, MB or GB specifies the units in which the size should be
       interpreted. For example:
       vcd limit 6GB
       or
       vcd limit 400MB
     * Taglists (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset
       of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also
       by  the  contents  of  attributes  attached to said elements. This
       pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the
       attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only
       one attribute comparison may be performed.
       For example, the following extraction parameter:
"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"
       will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet>
       but will not match the following element:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet>
     * The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility
       has  been  clarified  to  allow  various  parameters  to work more
       independently.  The  affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags,
       excludetags, and startstoring.
     * The change command can now be used to modify local variables in Verilog
       tasks and functions.
     * The profile UI has been modified in the following ways:
       - A new pane named "Design Units" has been added to the profile window.
       It aggregrates results on a per design unit basis.
       - "sum(Mem in)" and "sum(Mem in(%))" columns have been added to the
       Ranked and Design Units profile panes. These columns report cumulative
       values for memory in and memory in %, providing another metric to use
       when examining memory profile results.
       - Memory values are displayed in the profile windows as comma separated
       numbers rather than with K and M suffixes. This provides correspondence
       between the printed size of the number and its actual value; the goal is
       to make the data easier to read.
     * When  encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters
       defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the
       encrypted Verilog file.
     * When the "tagprefix" is not explicitly specified, the testplan "title"
       is used. If this title string contains whitespace, the whitespace is now
       replaced with underscore characters for use in tag strings.
