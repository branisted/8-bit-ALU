<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.6
Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries"
in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models.

</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
the 5.6e release. If you are migrating to the 5.6e release from
5.4 and earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6x and
5.5x release notes for product changes and new features introduced
during the 5.6 and 5.5 patch releases. The previous version
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation at
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are built
on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX 10.20 environment, you
must use the hp700_1020 platform executables. Please note that in order for
FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed correctly by the hp700
version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0. For the
hp700_1020 version of vsim, shared libraries must be compiled and linked on
HP-UX 10.20.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message
similar to "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00".
Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
</li>
<li>
There is a signature change in the 5.6b ieee math_real library. If
you have a design that was compiled in 5.6 or 5.6a, which when
loaded with 5.6b or greater vsim produces error messages similar
to the following:<br>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.testbench because
modeltech/linux/../ieee.math_real has changed.<br>
# Error loading design<br>
</code>
then you need to recompile your design with 5.6e vcom. This change
is a result of a bug fix to improve the accuracy of the
representation of floating-point constants. See the 5.6b release
notes under VHDL Defects Repaired for details.

</li>
<li>
The WLF file format version has changed starting with ModelSim 5.6c.
Modelsim 5.6c and later releases will be able to read older WLF files.
Modelsim 5.6b and earlier releases will NOT be able to read WLF files generated
with ModelSim 5.6c and later releases. The WLF format changes improve the
reliability of manipulating the Wave/List windows while the simulation is
running.
</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
In the Dataflow window, clicking on an implicit signal that was generated from
a constant value (e.g., buf(out, 1'b0)) caused the display of a
"Cannot find net" error message.
</li>
<li>
Compare expand bitwise/buswise for vectors did not work.

</li>
<li>
Using Hide Selected when in Show Hierarchy mode would not work if the selected
instance was not the hierarchy block.
</li>
<li>
Dragging virtual signals into the Dataflow window produced errors.
The Dataflow window now ignores virtual signals.
</li>
<li>
Hierarchical path names for instance array items in a dataset were not 
handled correctly.  Paths to simulation instances were handled correctly.
A stack trace dialog was displayed when clicking on an instance array item
in the Structure window. Also, errors were displayed for commands entered
in the Main window.
</li>
<li>
The PrefSignals(geometry) (and other Pref<Window>(geometry) variables)
are used to set the default geometry of the particular window type.
These variables were ignored in the modelsim.tcl file.
</li>
<li>
The Dataflow TraceX function failed when an input transition to X occurred at 
the same time as the output; i.e. no delay through the gate.

</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window produced errors when a signal containing a VHDL signal 
attribute was dropped into the window.  The correct behavior is to ignore these
implicit signals.
</li>
<li>
The Waveform Compare dialog did not correctly handle signals or regions
whose names were extended identifiers.
</li>
<li>
Wave panes were saved in the wave format file in the order created,
instead of the order they appeared in the Wave window.  This resulted in the
wave format file restoring the wave panes in a different order.
</li>
<li>
A dataset snapshot sometimes produced an assertion similar to:<br>
<code>
   new_checkpoint: Assertion `(ch->flags & 0x01)==0' failed.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some cases the WLF files created with the dataset snapshot
feature were not readable and attempts to open them caused the
simulator to crash.
</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window produced a Tcl error when performing a TraceX or ChaseX and
no Wave window time cursor was active or if the cursor was beyond the end of 
simulation time (>$now). It will use $now in this situation and activate a wave
cursor in the default Wave window.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
System tasks like $display crashed when given a complete net array
as an argument.
</li>
<li>
Under optimization <b>-O5</b>, loops containing part-assignments to low-order 
bits of registers declared to be greater than 32 bits could be incorrectly
optimized.
In particular, uses of large registers might be hoisted out of loops, even
though their values changed within the loops.

</li>
<li>
Added signed support for register arrays, including memories.

</li>
<li>
The Verilog 2001 LRM (Section 2.5) requires that the size of any numeric literal
that does not have a specified size and has an unknown (x or z) high-order bit
will be determined from its surrounding expression. Previously, unsized literals
had length 32. The compiler has been changed to extend an unknown value in the
high-order bit to the full length of the expression containing the literal. This
new interpretation can be inhibited by including the new switch
<b>-vlog95compat</b> on the vlog command line.
</li>
<li>
When single-stepping through while and for loops, some loops could be
constructed so that the cursor would skip to a statement within the body of the
loop instead of moving to the loop's terminating condition. The compiler was
not emitting line number information on loop terminating conditions.
Consequently, the user interface would move the cursor to the line number of
the instructions emitted prior to the terminating condition. The compiler has
been changed to emit line number information prior to code for the
terminating condition. This change will affect execution counts when performing
line coverage. Line coverage will now correctly include evaluation of
terminating conditions and remove counts from lines that were incorrectly
identified with terminating conditions.
</li>
<li>
Delayed inputs (delayed versions of inputs in $setuphold/$recrem statements)
could have pulses shorter than the propagation delay extended.
</li>
<li>
The vlog compiler sometimes crashed when a parameter was used for the index of an
indexed part-select in a module port list.
</li>
<li>
When compiling a cell library with vlog <b>-fast</b>, distributed delays were
sometimes ignored. This happened for cells which were inlined,
had `delay_mode_path in effect, and did not have a specify block with
module path delays.
</li>
<li>
Forcing a verilog register with a delay of 0 sometimes caused
incorrect evaluation of statements sensitive to the register.
The statements were incorrectly evaluated at the next timestep where
there was an event instead of being evaluated at the current timestep.  For this
to occur, there must have been no pending events or processes.  If there were
pending events or processes, the statements would be evaluated correctly.
</li>
<li>
Improved Verilog pulse filtering to correctly handle pulses (including
negative pulses) in more complex waveforms.
</li>
<li>
A delay expression containing a function call crashed the simulator.
</li>
<li>
The vlog <b>-compile_uselib</b> switch sometimes crashed when compiling a 
very large design.
</li>
<li>
The simulator sometimes crashed when assigning to an out of bounds register 
part-select.
</li>
<li>
The fall delays of SDF INTERCONNECT statements were not correctly annotated to 
the inputs of optimized Verilog cells when +multisource_int_delays was specified.

</li>
<li>
Optimized Verilog cells did not choose the correct conditional specify path.
</li>
<li>
Optimized Verilog cells didn't report the annotated IOPATHs correctly (when
<b>+sdf_verbose</b> was specified).
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when an optimized Verilog cell was specified as a top 
level design unit.
</li>
<li>
An x or z assignment with a decimal base (e.g. 4'dx or 'dz) was
assigning 1 or 0, respectively. (This is a 
special case clarified in the 1364-2001 Standard which allows for
a single x or z specified for a decimal base.)
</li>
<li>
An expression containing the && or || operator and at least one constant
operand resulted in a compiler internal error if the expression was a port
connection.

</li>
<li>
Accesses of parameterized descending non-zero based memories were sometimes
miscalculated for modules compiled without the <b>-fast</b> option.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
The PLI function acc_set_value() supported the setting of bit-selects of
registers only with a delay model of accNoDelay.  This limitation is not part of
the IEEE Standard 1364 and no longer exists in ModelSim.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
With <b>-O5</b> optimizations, if a call to a function or procedure in a 
package modified one of its parameters and was within a loop, scalar 
optimizations could be performed on the modified parameters, possibly undoing 
the effects of the function or procedure. Now <b>-O5</b> optimizations are not
performed on loops with calls to functions and procedures in packages.
</li>
<li>
An integer literal containing a signed exponent part (the sign must be +)
did not include the exponent in the value of the integer. For example, 2e+008
was evaluated as 2, rather than 200000000. The compiler was changed so that
integers can have signed exponent parts, as well as exponent parts without a
sign.
</li>
<li>
When compiling a configuration declaration, the following warning is now
generated if the configuration name is the same as the entity name:<br>
<pre>
"Configuration <i>config_name</i> is replacing entity with the same name."
</pre>



</li>
<li>
The ranges of the return values of the internally accelerated To_StdLogicVector
functions did not match the ranges of the return values of the
std_logic_1164 package VHDL functions.
</li>
<li>
The VHDL compiler was incorrectly reporting an error while mapping actual
parameters to formals when the source contained named associations.

This error occurred only in cases where a formal parameter was a nested
array/record (e.g., an array of records, a record of records, etc.) and
the parameter order did not group all elements of the nested type together.
</li>
<li>
In some cases ports of type RECORD crashed the simulator. The crash occurred
when the record type consisted of only one scalar element. The port map 
uses subelement association and the actual must be a scalar signal that is not 
part of another composite.
</li>
<li>
The <b>splitio</b> command would not always create an output VHDL array signal 
with the correct range. In some cases the range was in reference to the actual 
signal in the instantiated instance instead of the VHDL array signal. The
incorrect behaivor was visible in the Signals window or VCD files.

</li>
<li>
Type descriptors of string literals could be uninitialized when:<br>
<ol>
<li>  The literals had the same length.
<li>  The literals were associated to ports that had constrained types.
<li>  The literals occurred within direct entity instantiations.
<li>  The first entity instantiation was within a conditional generate
 statement whose condition at elaboration time evaluated to false, thereby
 cancelling the instantiation and leaving all shared type descriptors
 uninitialized.
</ol>
 These symptoms can be eliminated by leaving the ports unconstrained.
</li>
<li>
If the default binding rules selected an entity that was out-of-date with
respect to its dependencies, vcom would issue an error message but the
compilation would complete successfully.  The successful compilation would make
the default binding OPEN. The compiler now issues a warning about being unable
to load the default entity.

</li>
<li>
The simulator did not catch out-of-date dependencies in some cases.
If an entity and its architecture both had a dependency on a package that
changed, and only the entity was recompiled, the architecture would
load without any error messages. In some cases this resulted in a simulator
crash.
</li>
<li>
<b>vsim</b> crashed due to a stack overflow which could occur if a subprogram
contained declarations of record or array variables.  The overflow would occur
if the variables were declared to be very large.  Although it is still
possible to overflow the stack, the chances have been reduced.
</li>
<li>
Pulse rejection behavior of VHDL "reject" was not working correctly as of
the ModelSim 5.6 release.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
The FLI now ensures that the VPI is properly initialized before calling
the LoadDone callbacks.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
The VitalMemoryViolation routine sometimes failed.
</li>
<li>
Designs containing SDF-annotated accelerated VITAL models did not 
<b>checkpoint</b> and <b>restore</b> properly. After a cold restore, 
incorrect delays would sometimes be chosen. This problem also occurred 
when using the <b>-elab</b>/<b>-load_elab</b> options.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a VHDL top level had a Verilog parameterized array of instances under
its hierarchy, the simulation crashed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>vsim</b> option <b>-keepstdout</b> can now be specified with the
<b>-load_elab</b> option.
</li>
<li>
Setting the PathSeparator to a backslash "\" caused failures and possibly 
ModelSim to hang.  Now an error is reported if an attempt is made to set the
PathSeparator to a backslash "\" character and the value is forced to a 
forward slash "/".
</li>
<li>
A "Memory Failure" could occur when using Signal Spy on an array
in a mixed HDL design.
</li>
<li>
When doing a restart of a <b>vsim -load_elab</b> design, the
original vsim arguments are now used to set up SDF files, if any,
for back-annotation of the design.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mgcdefects"></a><b>Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.6e</b>
<ul>
<li>
DR 277272 - The VHDL compiler incorrectly determined that the type descriptor
of the string was identical to the type descriptor of the slice, because they
were the same lexically. Because the upper bound of the slice was determined by
a non-static variable, the slice was not identical to the string. The compiler
has been changed to perform lexical comparisons on type descriptors only when
they are static.
</li>
<li>
DR 328141 - Wave panes were saved in the wave format file in the order created,
instead of the order they appeared in the Wave window.  This resulted in the
wave format file restoring the wave panes in a different order.
</li>
<li>
DR328241 - Optimization problem with "posedge A or negedge A".
</li>
<li>
DR 326845 - The alignment field in the button_adder dialogue does not work.
</li>
<li>
DR 328625 - Cannot compare regions that use extended identifiers.
</li>
<li>
DR 329058 - The shift command does not work.
</li>
<li>
DR 321992 - _lock file problems when running compile script.<P>

The simulator crash that caused the lock file problem was extremely rare, 
(a recursive stack overflow), and caused the compiler to not be able to 
catch the signal and clean up after itself.


</li>
<li>
DR 329692 - ModelSim crashes when using "dataset snapshot" with option "-mode
sequential."
</li>
<li>
DR 329917 - Chase X doesn't work correctly and crashes on 64-bit ModelSim.
</li>
<li>
DR 329927 - Latest LEON code fails in 5.6d, works in 5.6b.
</li>
<li>
DR 329939 - Problem with VCD generation.<br>

There are three new options to the vcd2wlf utility for splitting Extended VCD port
values into their corresponding input and output components by creating two signals
instead of just one in the resulting WLF file. By default, the new input-component
signal keeps the same name as the original port name while the output-component
name is the original name with an "__o" appended to it. The new options are:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>-splitio
<LI>-splitio_in_ext extension
<LI>-splitio_out_ext extension
</UL><BR>
The latter two options allow the default extension to be changed.
</li>
<li>
DR 328621 - Vsim crashes when loading ROM.<BR>

<b>vsim</b> crashed due to a stack overflow which occurred if a
subprogram contained declarations of record or array variables.
The overflow occurred if the variables declared were very large. 
Although it is now still possible to overflow the stack, the chances 
have been reduced.
</li>
<li>
DR 291817 - wrong "ERROR: Recompile ... because ... changed."<BR>

Two issues were addressed in this DR.<P>

If the default binding rules selected an entity that was out-of-date with
respect to its dependencies, vcom would issue an error message but the
compile would complete successfully.  The successful compile would make
the default binding OPEN.  The compile now issues a warning abound being
unable to load the default entity.<P>

The simulator would not catch out-of-date dependencies in some cases.
If an entity and its architecture both had a dependency on a package that
changed, and only the entity was recompiled, the architecture would
load without any error messages.  In some cases this could result
in a simulator crash.
</li>
<li>
DR 308180 - "Define Clock" window has unnecessary restrictions on entering 
values in fields.

<li>
The concatenation operator produces results that follow 1993 LRM rules
for concatentation, independently of the <b>-87</b> or <b>-93</b> vcom switches.
Starting with release 5.6, the result of a concatenation has an array index
range that adheres to the 1993 rules as denoted in "7.2.4 Adding operators"
in the LRM.  In past releases, the array bounds of a concatenation
were computed following the 1987 rules, sometimes deviating
from them.   Since the 1987 rules were not well formed, the 1993 rules
are being followed now.  This will have its most noticeable impact when
the result of a concatentation is passed as the actual to a formal with
an unconstrained array type, since the formal takes on the bounds of the actual
in this case.
</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window automatically hides the contents of instances that have 
either 'celldefine, VITAL_LEVEL0, or VITAL_LEVEL1 attributes. To display the 
contents of a particular instance, select the instance and choose 
Navigate->Show Selected from the menu.  To disable automatic cell recognition, 
unselect the "Hide cells" in the Tools->Options dialog box.

There are three new options to the vcd2wlf utility for splitting Extended VCD
port values into their corresponding input and output components by creating two
signals instead of just one in the resulting WLF file.  By default, the new
input-component signal keeps the same name as the original port name while
the output-component name is the original name with an "__o" appended to it.
The new options are:<br>
<UL>
<LI> -splitio
<LI> -splitio_in_ext <i>extension</i>
<LI> -splitio_out_ext <i>extension</i>
</UL>
The latter two options allow the default extension to be changed.

</li>
<li>
Signal Spy (init_signal_spy and init_signal_driver) now supports spying
or driving the following in VHDL-based designs:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Records
<LI>Elements of Records
<LI>Arrays of Arrays
<LI>Multi-dimensional Arrays
<LI>Arrays of Records
<LI>Arrays of Reals
<LI>Arrays of Time
</UL>
This new functionality is limited in that you cannot reference a bit or
slice of the above arrays, as well as a bit or slice of an element of a record.
The prior limitation, with respect to referencing a bit, will not exist in the
5.7 release of ModelSim.
</li>
<li>
In the recent release of ModelSim, the Dataflow window is popped-up when
a double-click is done in the waveform pane of the Wave window.
This is to display the signals driving process(es).
It's useful, but some customers asked that there be a way to disable this
link of both windows.
The PrefWave(ShowDriversEnabled) preference was added to turn this link
on or off.
This preference can be modified from the Wave window menu
"Tools->Window Preferences".
