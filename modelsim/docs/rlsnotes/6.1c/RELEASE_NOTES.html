<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
<br>
The support includes the following platforms:
<br>
<ul>
<li>32-bit linux
<li>64-bit linux_x86_64 
</ul>
<p>
For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under the section Supported platforms.</li>
<li>
The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Windows 98
<li>Windows ME
<li>Windows NT 4.0
<li>Solaris 2.6
<li>Solaris 7
<li>AIX 4.3
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.

<UL>Solaris 10 has the following limitations:

<LI>In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between 20ms and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error message, "Too few samples."  To workaround this problem, add the following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:<br>
set hires_tick=1<br>
This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris releases.
<LI>In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the system and produce a messages like "nfs server array not responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6296698.
<LI>In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any  PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will break under Solaris 10.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 6.0x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is supported.  Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches <b>-87</b>, <b>-93</b>, or <b>-2002</b>, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>
The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5; Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
<p>
CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
<p>
For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software
being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
(i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
need to do anything.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit() task.</li>
<li>
The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit" variable in the modelsim.ini file.  By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.  The default time unit in SystemC can also be set using the sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like sc_clock or sc_time is created.</li>
<li>
vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar to the vsim command line options.</li>
<li>
Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option
has changed behavior somewhat.  This primarily affects
win32 and rs6000 users.

<OL>
<LI>You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename.
   That will be done for you automatically now.</LI>

<LI>There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'"
   to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line.</LI>
</OL>
The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat
files have been modified to show the correct flow now.
</li>
<li>
Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher will not
run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:<br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).<br>
# Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled<br>
# version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library<br>
# was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make<br>
# sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.<br>

The sequence of characters presented to the TEXTIO.READ() procedure for type REAL, as well as in the string parameter X to the predefined attribute <floating_point_type>'VALUE(X), is defined by the LRM as requiring the presence of a decimal/base point (the dot character).  For backwards compatibility with previous releases which did not enforce this requirement, this requirement has been relaxed.  The default behavior for such mal-formed (and thus non-portable) real literals is for the simulator to produce a warning message and continue.</li>

<ul>

QAVersion: 1.0
It is now possible to declare VPI and FLI functions as DPI-C imports. In such cases it is not necessary to provide a C implementation of the import tf, nor is it necessary to make use of the <b>-sv_lib</b> switch to load a DPI shared object at runtime.  Note that on most platforms, it is also possible to declare most standard C library functions as DPI-C imports.  The simulator can now process the following example with no DPI C code, and no vsim <b>-sv_lib</b> switch:

<PRE>
package cmath;
    import "DPI-C" function real sin(input real x);
    import "DPI-C" function real sqrt(input real x);
endpackage

package fli;
    import "DPI-C" function mti_Cmd(input string cmd);
endpackage

module top;
    import cmath::*;
    import fli::*;
    int status, A;
    initial begin
        $display("sin(0.98) = %f", sin(0.98));
        $display("sqrt(0.98) = %f", sqrt(0.98));
        status = mti_Cmd("change A 123");
        $display("A = %1d, status = %1d", A, status);
    end
endmodule
</PRE>

This feature is not supported on AIX.
<br>
On Windows, only FLI and PLI commands may be imported in this fashion.  C library functions are not automatically importable. They must be wrapped in user DPI C functions, which are brought into the simulator via the <b>-sv_lib</b> switch.</li>
<li>
QAVersion: 1.0
Support for mixed language design has been added in the SystemC sc_object::name() object. The SystemC object is aware of the HDL context that instantiates the SystemC design unit. The name() interface gives the full hierarchical name.

</li>
<li>
QAVersion: 1.0
The default name for an sc_object is bound to the actual C object name. When an sc_object is instantiated without a user name, previously the simulator gave the kernel generated names as by default for this sc_object. This was fixed and the simulator now binds the actual C object name with sc_object. There is one limitation. This name binding only happens after all sc_object constructors are executed. So a name() call inside the constructors will not pick up this change. This feature is not available for HP platforms.</li>
