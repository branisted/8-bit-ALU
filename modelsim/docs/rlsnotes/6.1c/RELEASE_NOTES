   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: tonyj Testcase: vcd2wlf Fixed a vcd2wlf problem
       with vcd dumpports input files that were generated using the -direction
       switch.
     * QAVersion:  1.0  Author:  gordonv  In  some  cases Verilog 2001 @*
       sensitivities involving hierarchical references would create invalid
       events causing crashes during simulation, particularly during logging or
       design exploration in the GUI.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.

     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: bgriffin The "contains" filter for the Objects
       window became disabled after undocking the Objects window.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: bgriffin Closing the List window by using the
       File->Close menu option in the undocked List window caused any future
       view list commands to fail.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: bgriffin The View->Bookmarks menu in an undocked
       Wave window did not work.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: bgriffin The Source window file lookup variables

       from the Wave Properties Dialog box if the popup option was disabled.
     * Opening a file in a project will now use the default tool that the user
       may have specified in Internet Explorer. This is a Windows only issue.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: dlowder Each call to restart -f took longer than
       the previous call when running from within the graphical user interface.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: cswart Testcase: None Clearquest ID: 294074 If
       the GUI was invoked and then the current working directory was deleted,
       then the quit command failed to cause the GUI to exit.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: tonyj Testcase: sparsemem/memtool The simulator
       crashed when expanding large sparse arrays in the Wave window.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: ymahmoud@model.com Clearquest ID: dts0100295014
       ModelSim suspended if minimized while loading a design.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: bgriffin Testcase: bugzilla_batch/4028 Bugzilla

     * QAVersion:  1.0 Author: mlin Testcase: will be memtool_gui/rmb The
       RightMouseButton in the Object window and Memtool tab took a long time
       to bring up the popup menu with a large design.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1c
     * Internal  compiler  errors  were  reported when compiling packages
       containing procedural continuous assignments within tasks.
     * Some compiler optimizations failed in the presence of System Verilog
       2-state types.
     * Some  compiler  optimizations failed in the presence of assignment
       expressions used in arguments to function, task, and system task calls.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Some compiler optimizations failed in the presence of
       SystemVerilog randomize() calls.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 The simulator crashed when instantiating a module that
       was  inlined from another library that referred to a function in a
       non-inlined module from that other library.
     * Module instance parameter value assignments evaluated to incorrect
       values  in  some  cases where the value itself contained parameter
       references. The failure also occured in mixed VHDL/Verilog designs where
       the parameter value assignment ultimately updates a VHDL generic.
     * Some cases of concatenations connected to module ports resulted in an
       internal error in vopt.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 If code coverage was turned on within a SystemVerilog
       package or global declaration region, the simulator crashed in certain
       cases.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Cells with delayed inputs, for negative timing checks,
       modeled with additional hardwiring to the input experienced X glitches
       in certain cases.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: howardj Testcase: tests/bugzilla_batch/3667
       Bugzilla ID: 3667 The compiler failed to detect illegal assignments
       within program blocks in some cases.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: stevesg Testcase: coverage_new3 now produces
       results/incrMerge.cov There was a problem when merging two coverage
       reports files where the first file had enumerated types but the second
       did not.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: stevesg Testcase: TBD Bugzilla ID: 3800 The
       simulator crashed after an elaboration failed due to a dependency check.
       Now the simulator terminates smoothly after such a failure.
     * QAVersion:      1.0     Author:     jamiel@model.com     Testcase:
       svlog_types/src/queue4.sv  Bugzilla ID: 3705 SystemVerilog classes
       contained in unpacked structs sometimes became corrupted when the struct
       was  copied (for example: when inserting into a queue or a dynamic
       array).
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: howardj Testcase: tests/fast/src/suppress1.v An
       optimized design crashed in the simulator in some cases if it contained
       always constructs having multiple clocks in the sensitivity list.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: jinsley Testcase: systask/fscanToMemory When
       using $fgets to read to the word of a memory, the simulator did not
       return the '\n' as $fgets is defined to do. As a result, reading an
       empty line behaved like an EOF, returning a count of 0 charaters read.
       Now the behavior matches the LRM behavior for registers.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: gordonv There were problems involving defparam
       statements whose path went through an unconditional generate block and
       then a generate loop or conditional block.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: stevesg Testcase: None When a +acc option was
       specified before the -fast option on the vlog command line, it had the
       effect of setting too many acc options and decreasing the amount of
       optimization that occurred.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: howardj Testcase: tests/bugzilla_batch/4010
       Bugzilla ID: 4010 Non-blocking assignments having a target indexed by a
       parameter resulted in an internal compiler error in some cases if the
       design was compiled as a SystemVerilog design.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: howardj Testcase: tests/vlog_misc/src/test98.v
       Deeply nested case statements through the default clause resulted in
       very long compile times.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: rryan@model.com Testcase: bugzilla/3762 Bugzilla
       ID: 3762 In SystemVerilog, adding the 'randc' modifier to a variable
       declared as an array of a user defined type caused a compilation error
       even if the user defined type was a 'bit' type.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: rryan@model.com Testcase: bugzilla/3721 Bugzilla
       ID: 3721 In SystemVerilog, the simulation crashed in certain cases on
       calls to the pre-defined 'rand_mode' method of a class variable when the
       variable was not declared as 'rand' and another instance of the class
       was declared as 'rand'.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: rryan@model.com Testcase: bugzilla/3686 Bugzilla
       ID: 3686 In SystemVerilog, the simulation crashed in certain cases on
       calls   to   'rand_mode'   for  the  elements  of  an  array,  eg.
       arr[1].a.rand_mode(1).
     * QAVersion:     1.0     Author:     rduncan@model.com     Testcase:
       unpackArr_defaultLog_impfIno DPI import declaration parameters in which
       an array element type was not specified (i.e., defaults to the 'logic'
       type) no longer causes a vlog crash.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: tejbals Testcase: svlog_bind There were incorrect
       error messages generated when binding interfaces using 'bind'. Binding
       interfaces is now supported.
     * QAVersion:  1.0 Author: kapila Testcase: sdfvlog/45 Clearquest ID:
       dts0100281013 Nets that made a single transtion to Z, at initialization
       time, went to X when back annotated with an INTERCONNECT delay.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: kapila Testcase: sdfvlog/46 Simulation results
       could be incorrect when cells without `timescale directive were compiled
       with -fast option and applied SDF.
     * QAVersion:  1.0  Author:  ronr  Testcase: To be added to vlog_wild
       Clearquest  ID:  0100291714 In always_comb blocks, ModelSim is now
       sensitive to any change in an array when the array index is a variable.
     * QAVersion:      1.0     Author:     jamiel@model.com     Testcase:
       sysVerilog_dev/Sec11_Classes/class_fwd1.sv   Bugzilla   ID:   2356
       SystemVerilog class definitions with circular type dependencies reported
       an error incorrectly. Circular class dependendencies are now supported.

   Product Changes to 6.1c
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: howardj Testcase: none required The SmartModel
       library Verilog PLI interface application (libswiftpli.sl) was removed
       in  the 6.1b release. The library was added back for the platforms
       supported by Xilinx to maintain compatibility with Xilinx flows.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: vince Testcase: vcover We have changed how vcover
       behaves when the design it is trying to merge has changed from the
       target design. Previously we attempted to create a merger of the two
       designs, but this sometimes failed. We changed the behavior to write a
       warning to the vcover.log file, and skip the rest of the instance that
       changed. If you don't want to see the warnings, we added a -quiet option
       to vcover.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1c
     * QAVersion: 1.0 It is now possible to declare VPI and FLI functions as
       DPI-C  imports.  In  such cases it is not necessary to provide a C
       implementation of the import tf, nor is it necessary to make use of the
       -sv_lib switch to load a DPI shared object at runtime. Note that on most
       platforms,  it is also possible to declare most standard C library
       functions as DPI-C imports. The simulator can now process the following
       example with no DPI C code, and no vsim -sv_lib switch:
package cmath;
    import "DPI-C" function real sin(input real x);
    import "DPI-C" function real sqrt(input real x);
endpackage

package fli;
    import "DPI-C" function mti_Cmd(input string cmd);
endpackage

module top;
    import cmath::*;
    import fli::*;
    int status, A;
    initial begin
        $display("sin(0.98) = %f", sin(0.98));
        $display("sqrt(0.98) = %f", sqrt(0.98));
        status = mti_Cmd("change A 123");
        $display("A = %1d, status = %1d", A, status);
    end
endmodule
       This feature is not supported on AIX.
       On Windows, only FLI and PLI commands may be imported in this fashion. C
       library functions are not automatically importable. They must be wrapped
       in user DPI C functions, which are brought into the simulator via the
       -sv_lib switch.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Support for mixed language design has been added in the
       SystemC sc_object::name() object. The SystemC object is aware of the HDL
       context that instantiates the SystemC design unit. The name() interface
       gives the full hierarchical name.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 The default name for an sc_object is bound to the actual
       C object name. When an sc_object is instantiated without a user name,
       previously the simulator gave the kernel generated names as by default
       for this sc_object. This was fixed and the simulator now binds the
       actual C object name with sc_object. There is one limitation. This name
       binding only happens after all sc_object constructors are executed. So a
       name() call inside the constructors will not pick up this change. This
       feature is not available for HP platforms.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Arrays of modules are now viewable in GUI windows.
     * QAVersion:  1.0 Author: rwold The switch -nosplash was added which
       disables the splash screen. The switch applies to modelsim.exe only.
       This is a Windows only feature.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: huiyin Testcase:
       tests_systemc/misc_tests/valgrind_fuji_xerox_test Valgrind support in
       ModelSim simulation is added to help users detecting and tracking down
       the  memory  usage errors in C/C++ source files in the design. The
       valgrind tool is limited to use with x86/linux based platforms only.
       Please refer to Application Note "Using the valgrind tool with ModelSim"
       for detailed usage information.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Windows platforms only - added a -nosplash switch which
       disables the splash screen. The switch is applied to modelsim.exe only.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: markvp Testcase: TBD Clearquest ID: 00198057 For
       PE only, added a new vsim command line switch -lic_no_viewer and a
       corresponding modelsim.ini setting in the License variables section
       called noviewer. When the switch is set with PE, viewer license checkout
       is disabled.
     * QAVersion:  1.0  Author: mikew Testcase: misc The WLFSizeLimit and
       WLFTimeLimit controls have been added to the report simulator control
       command output.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: vasuc Testcase: startup_dialog/vcom-vopt "Use
       vopt flow" check box has been added to the VHDL tab in the Compile
       dialog box.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: arnabs Testcase:
       tests_systemc/fli_pli_tests/sensitize[01  -  03] Bugzilla ID: 3482
       mti_Sensitize() and mti_Desensitize() FLI functions are enahanced to
       handle SystemC ports and signals. These function can now be used to make
       a  FLI  process be sensitive to a SystemC port or signal. Only the
       MTI_EVENT trigger or sensitivity mode is supported for SystemC signals.
     * QAVersion: 1.0 Author: vasuc Testcase:
       tests_systemc/misc_tests/profiler_test,
       tests_systemc/misc_tests/stacktrace_test  SystemC  symbols  in the
       stacktrace and the profile reports are now demangled.
     * QAVersion:  1.0  Author:  kapila Testcase: sdfvlog/47 Two compiler
       directives to control the mode of INTERCONNECT annotation to a module
       instance  ports  were  added.  Any instances of modules within the
       `mti_v2k_int_delays_on and `mti_v2k_int_delays_off directives will be
       treated as if -v2k_int_delays switch has been turned on at simulation
       time. The directives have to be enclosed within a `ifdef MODEL_TECH and
       a corresponding `endif.
