<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>64-bit ModelSim is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.8x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the ModelSim User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 6.0a
release. If you are migrating to the 6.0a release from 6.0, 5.8x or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0 and 5.8x release notes for product changes and new features introduced during the 6.0 and 5.8x releases. The previous version release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at 
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2.  The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2.  If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.  If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU zip format (.gz).  Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).  ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system version and C++ compiler version.  The OS support is slightly different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches -87, -93, or -2002, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The Wave and List windows did not update when ModelSim stopped at a Cdebug prompt because of a C breakpoint.</li>
<li>
The "Goto time" pulldown menu was not functioning as expected.</li>
<li>
Compiling SystemC source often took a long time and did give the user status. Now the lower left corner of vsim Main window shows the progress of sccom with a blue color bar.</li>
<li>
SystemC Option changes from the Compile Options dialog are saved in modelsim.ini now.</li>
<li>
The preference dialog is supporting Memory, Functional Coverage and Assertions windows.</li>
<li>
The Add Menu from top of the Main window caused Tcl Trace errors when the Functional Coverage window was the focus.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command did not work on objects that were accessed through multiple access types.  For example, if S is a record with a field named nxt that is an access type to another record, the command <b>change s.nxt.field value</b> produced an error. The 6.0 release notes stated erroneously that this defect was fixed in ModelSim 6.0.</li>
<li>
The option <b>-fillradix</b> was added to the <b>mem load</b> command.  This new option specifies the radix of the data specified by the option <b>-filldata</b>.</li>
<li>
New project 'Add Files' copy failed to update the new location of files. When adding and choosing to copy these files to the local directory, the project file reference now correctly points at the copied file.</li>
<li>
ModelSim failed if there was an existing work subdirectory. Creating a new project will now produce an error if a directory with a name matching the library name already exists.  
</li>
<li>
Changing the PrefCoverage(cutoff) value resulted in an error.</li>
<li>
In the Memory View, a Double-Click in the address column below the last address resulted in a Tcl error.</li>
<li>
Logging shared variables or signals from a package caused a crash when attempting to read the WLF file post-simulation.</li>
<li>
The <b>project calculateorder</b> command produced the error message "Invalid command name".</li>
<li>
If the simulation terminated unexpectedly during the first <b>run</b> command, in some cases wlfrecover could not recover the WLF file.</li>
<li>
On hpux_ia64 the C Debug tool was receiving erroneous source line information from wdb 4.2.</li>
<li>
The submenu of File->Recent Projects wasn't working when there was no recent project.</li>
<li>
The popup menu "View Instantiation" of structure list was not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Implicit conditions in $setuphold and $recrem that conflict with explicit conditions on either a reference or data event were not fully ignored.</li>
<li>
Designs with Verilog generate constructs crashed in certain cases.</li>
<li>
Designs with a large numbers of port connections (positional or named) took a long time to compile and elaborate.</li>
<li>
A Verilog design containing an array of type real inside an interface
resulted in an incorrect waveform and the following error message at
simulation run-time:<br>
INTERNAL ERROR: Illegal array element type in log_vlog_mem_elmt_event: 15</li>
<li>
A design optimized with <b>vopt</b> or <b>-fast</b> having a concatenation connected to the port of an inlined module resulted in a crash of the optimizer if a function call was used in a bit-select or part-select reference of the corresponding port (in some unusual cases only).</li>
<li>
The compilers <b>+opt</b> option incorrectly required the existence of the "work" library even if none of the optimized design units resided in the "work" library.</li>
<li>
An instance of a module compiled with <b>-fast</b> and <b>+acc</b> or <b>+acc=r</b> in some cases got incorrect parameter value assignments, if the module instantiation assigned parameter values by ordered list.
</li>
<li>
Added support of <b>+show_cancelled_e</b> for optimized Verilog gates.</li>
<li>
In some situations, ModelSim's evcd information for dumpports was incorrect.  In addition ModelSim's dumpports reporting made some values appear as ambiguous strength values.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The PLI function acc_next_bit() had a performance problem.</li>
<li>
The acc_handle_by_name and acc_handle_object routines failed to reject malformed bit-selects. Specifically, if the bit-select started correctly with '[' followed by a decimal number, then any following non-number character was accepted as proper termination of the bit-select.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Line number information is now emitted by the compiler for generic and port maps, as well as certain optimized signal assignments. When a simulation-time error occurs during elaboration of these constructs, and if the AssertionFormatFatal string is defined in the modelsim.ini file and contains the %L specifier, the line number of the error will be printed in the transcript.</li>
<li>
In some cases, when certain types of signals were displayed in the Object window vsim crashed. This only occured when the signals displayed were NULL arrays of records.</li>
<li>
In some cases, invoking with the <b>-coverage</b> switch crashed the simulator during elaboration. The crash was caused by defining a resolution function within an architecture.</li>
<li>
Direct instantiation of an entity with a scalar port or generic constrained by a non-locally static subtype in some cases caused a crash at simulation-time due to misallocation of the object's type descriptor by the compiler.</li>
<li>
Logical operators were mistakenly defined for the predefined types severity_level, file_open_kind, and file_open_status.</li>
<li>
There was a problem when forcing VHDL boolean arrays with bit vector syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
On win32 only, the simulator crashed if the top level SystemC module was not exported using the SC_MODULE_EXPORT macro.</li>
<li>
Restart was not supported on SystemC designs on Windows.</li>
<li>
SystemC shared library is now unloaded on Windows in case of a Fatal error.  The shared library will no longer be locked after a fatal error and write operations like sccom -link can be performed on the shared library after a fatal load error.  This was a known defect in the 6.0 release.</li>
<li>
There was a problem compiling SystemC via the GUI for alternate libraries.</li>
<li>
When attempting to set a breakpoint in SystemC C++ code, the following
error was produced:<br>
Internal error in reading shared library information" on HP-UX 11.11.



</li>
<li>
HP-UX 11.11 is now supported for SystemC. The following patch is required:
B.11.11.0306 Gold Base Patches for HP-UX 11i, June 2003.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="psldefects"></a><b>PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
VHDL assertion settings such as suppressing a particular severity or breaking on a severity were altering the PSL assertions. Now VHDL assertion setting do not affect temporal assertions.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when a multiclocked assertion was disabled either directly by the user or when it hit the max fail/pass count.</li>
<li>
Designs with PSL statements could not be checkpointed.</li>
<li>
There were some problems with parameterized VHDL PSL statements where the parameters were used in a slice range.</li>
<li>
Changed PSL output messages to always include the start time for passed, failed, and covered messages.</li>
<li>
If a design unit containing assertion or cover directives was optimized
without the <b>+acc=a</b> flag, the directives were mistakenly allowed
to be added to the List and Wave windows. These non-browseable
directives are now prevented from being added the Wave or List
windows. </li>
<li>
A simulation break occurred at a PSL assert rather then a VHDL assert even though PSL failure action was set to 'continue' and VHDL assert action was set to 'break'.</li>
<li>
Sometimes designs with PSL assertions crashed when compiling with vopt or vlog <b>-fast</b> when <b>+acc</b> access was disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
A multisource interconnect delay in a mixed language design that traversed multiple levels of hierarchy could give incorrect results.</li>
<li>
The vgencomp tool failed to recognize explicitly typed Verilog parameters and always generated a VHDL generic type based on the type of the initial value of the parameter rather than the explicit type.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Windows documents a list of illegal file names that are device drivers.
For the work library we map module names, entity names, and architecture 
names that would become an illegal name into a legal name. For this
release we extended the list of illegal names that we recognize to
include the complete list that Microsoft documents. We do this mapping
on all platforms to create a portable library format. This mapping is
not customer visible, except that prior to 5.8e a valid module name would
fail to compile on Windows due to matching an illegal Windows file name.</li>
<li>
If a memory was in the top level module, the memory was listed twice in the Memory window.</li>
<li>
The <b>vcover</b> command reported incorrect statistics in incremental (<b>-incr</b>) mode when a subsequent data file subsumes the coverage of the base file.</li>
<li>
With code coverage turned on, condition coverage sometimes gave unexpected
behavior when variables that took on unknown values were compared against
literal constants.</li>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
The new (6.0) Watch window has a problem with the mouse cursor grabbing
existing items while dragging another item over the top of them.</li>
<li>
The new (6.0) Watch window re-arranges everything in it to the upper-left corner
when dropping a new item in to it.</li>
<li>
The new (6.0) Watch window does not allow drag and drop from other windows when
it is undocked.</li>
<li>
When you are creating a code coverage exclusion file, the filenames you enter
must use the same paths that were given for the file to <b>vcom</b> or 
<b>vlog</b>. Otherwise you will get an error: "** Warning: (vsim-3684) File 
'/u/xx/src/test.vhd' has no coverage data associated with it."</li>
<li>
Synopsys SmartModels can crash on the hppa64 platform.</li>
<li>
Profiling is not supported on the linux_x86_64 platform (64-bit ModelSim for the AMD Opteron) and may cause ModelSim to crash.
</li>
<li>
Delayed virtual signals, that specify the delay using pound-sign notation within
the expression, will not work correctly for triggering the list window. Instead,
use the <b>virtual signal -delay</b> option for specifying the delay. That seems
to work correctly.</li>
<li>
If you do a search in the Wave window on a bit of a multi-bit Verilog register,
and you are counting falling transitions, the count may be incorrect. (Transitions
are counted by setting up the search for an excessive number of transitions,
then the search reports the number actually found when the end of file is hit.)</li>
<li>
Processing of the PSL cover directive will produce too many matches
in some circumstances, causing the cover count to be too high. The problem
occurs with coverage of sequences like {{a;b} | {c;d}} or {a[*1 to 2]; 
b[*1 to 2]}.
In sequences like these, the same sequence for the same input at the 
same start time may succeed simultaneously in multiple ways. For example, the first sequence may succeed with a and c followed on the next cycle by b and d;
this satisfies both the simultaneous {a;b} and {c;d} sequences. Logically,
the evaluation should increment the count once and only once for a single
directive with a given set of inputs from a given start time. However, 
in the above example, the Modelsim 6.0 implementation will increment the count
twice.</li>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.0a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Waveform compare was enhanced for SystemC signals and variables.<br>

<UL>
<LI>You can compare SystemC items to SystemC, Verilog or VHDL items.<br>
<LI>For pure SystemC compares, you can compare any two signals that match type and size exactly; for C/C++ types and some SystemC types, sign is ignored for compares.  Thus, you can compare char to unsigned char or sc_signed to sc_unsigned.  
<LI>All SystemC fixed-point types may be mixed as long as the total number of bits and the number of integer bits match.<br>
</UL>

Mixed language compares are supported as follows:<BR>

Supported C/C++ types:
<UL>
    <LI>bool 
    <LI>char, unsigned char 
    <LI>short, unsigned short 
    <LI>int, unsigned int 
    <LI>long, unsigned long 
  </UL>
  Supported SC types:
  <UL>
    <LI>sc_bit, sc_bv 
    <LI>sc_logic, sc_lv 
    <LI>sc_int, sc_uint 
    <LI>sc_bigint, sc_bituint 
    <LI>sc_signed, sc_unsigned 
  </UL>
  Supported Verilog types:
  <UL>
    <LI>net 
    <LI>reg 
  </UL>
  Supported VHDL types:
  <UL>
    <LI>bit, bit_vector 
    <LI>boolean 
    <LI>std_logic, std_logic_vector 
  </UL>
 
  The number of elements must match for vectors; specific indexes are ignored. 

</li>
<li>
<b>-g</b> no longer truncates the given value to 32-bits.  For example '<b>-g</b>"p=40'hffff0000xx" will now properly set a Verilog parameter 'p' to a 40-bit value.</li>
<li>
A 'merge' function was added to the wlfman utility which will allow different signals from two wlf files to be merged into one wlf file.
</li>
<li>
Master slave library version 2.0-MS2.0b is now supported. The <b>-scms</b> option needs to be passed to sccom during compile and link.</li>
<li>
The Wave window will now open, by default, inside the Main window.  The window can be undocked from the Main window by pressing the undock button in the window header or by using the <b>view -undock wave</b> command.
