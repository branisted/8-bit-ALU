   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 6.0
       release.
          + 64-bit   ModelSim   is  supported  on  the  AMD  Opteron  and
            compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64)
            or  RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64
            platform.  The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in
            64-bit  mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also
            be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating
       your  design  libraries"  in  the  ModelSim User's Manual for more
       information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  6.0a  release.  If you are migrating to the 6.0a release from
       6.0, 5.8x or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0 and
       5.8x release notes for product changes and new features introduced
       during  the  6.0  and  5.8x releases. The previous version release
       notes  can  be  found  in your modeltech installation directory at
       docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and  greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version
            5.8b and greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32  XP  and  2000,  gcc  3.2.3  (ModelSim versions 6.0 and
            greater)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features:  the  first  is by using the -sv command line option and
       the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * The  Wave and List windows did not update when ModelSim stopped at
       a Cdebug prompt because of a C breakpoint.
     * The "Goto time" pulldown menu was not functioning as expected.
     * Compiling  SystemC  source often took a long time and did give the
       user  status.  Now the lower left corner of vsim Main window shows
       the progress of sccom with a blue color bar.
     * SystemC  Option  changes from the Compile Options dialog are saved
       in modelsim.ini now.
     * The  preference  dialog  is supporting Memory, Functional Coverage
       and Assertions windows.
     * The  Add  Menu from top of the Main window caused Tcl Trace errors
       when the Functional Coverage window was the focus.
     * The  change  command  did  not  work on objects that were accessed
       through  multiple access types. For example, if S is a record with
       a  field  named  nxt that is an access type to another record, the
       command  change  s.nxt.field  value  produced  an  error.  The 6.0
       release  notes  stated  erroneously  that this defect was fixed in
       ModelSim 6.0.
     * The  option -fillradix was added to the mem load command. This new
       option  specifies  the  radix  of the data specified by the option
       -filldata.
     * New  project 'Add Files' copy failed to update the new location of
       files.  When  adding and choosing to copy these files to the local
       directory,  the project file reference now correctly points at the
       copied file.
     * ModelSim  failed  if  there  was  an  existing  work subdirectory.
       Creating  a  new  project will now produce an error if a directory
       with a name matching the library name already exists.
     * Changing the PrefCoverage(cutoff) value resulted in an error.
     * In the Memory View, a Double-Click in the address column below the
       last address resulted in a Tcl error.
     * Logging  shared variables or signals from a package caused a crash
       when attempting to read the WLF file post-simulation.
     * The  project  calculateorder  command  produced  the error message
       "Invalid command name".
     * If  the  simulation  terminated  unexpectedly during the first run
       command, in some cases wlfrecover could not recover the WLF file.
     * On  hpux_ia64 the C Debug tool was receiving erroneous source line
       information from wdb 4.2.
     * The submenu of File->Recent Projects wasn't working when there was
       no recent project.
     * The  popup  menu  "View  Instantiation"  of structure list was not
       working.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * Implicit  conditions  in $setuphold and $recrem that conflict with
       explicit  conditions  on either a reference or data event were not
       fully ignored.
     * Designs with Verilog generate constructs crashed in certain cases.
     * Designs  with  a  large numbers of port connections (positional or
       named) took a long time to compile and elaborate.
     * A  Verilog  design  containing  an  array  of  type real inside an
       interface  resulted  in  an  incorrect  waveform and the following
       error message at simulation run-time:
       INTERNAL     ERROR:     Illegal     array    element    type    in
       log_vlog_mem_elmt_event: 15
     * A  design  optimized  with  vopt  or  -fast having a concatenation
       connected  to the port of an inlined module resulted in a crash of
       the  optimizer  if  a  function  call  was used in a bit-select or
       part-select  reference  of the corresponding port (in some unusual
       cases only).
     * The  compilers  +opt  option incorrectly required the existence of
       the  "work"  library  even  if  none of the optimized design units
       resided in the "work" library.
     * An  instance of a module compiled with -fast and +acc or +acc=r in
       some  cases  got  incorrect  parameter  value  assignments, if the
       module instantiation assigned parameter values by ordered list.
     * Added support of +show_cancelled_e for optimized Verilog gates.
     * In  some situations, ModelSim's evcd information for dumpports was
       incorrect.  In  addition  ModelSim's dumpports reporting made some
       values appear as ambiguous strength values.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * The PLI function acc_next_bit() had a performance problem.
     * The  acc_handle_by_name  and  acc_handle_object routines failed to
       reject  malformed  bit-selects.  Specifically,  if  the bit-select
       started  correctly with '[' followed by a decimal number, then any
       following  non-number character was accepted as proper termination
       of the bit-select.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * Line number information is now emitted by the compiler for generic
       and  port  maps,  as well as certain optimized signal assignments.
       When  a  simulation-time  error occurs during elaboration of these
       constructs,  and  if the AssertionFormatFatal string is defined in
       the  modelsim.ini  file  and  contains  the %L specifier, the line
       number of the error will be printed in the transcript.
     * In some cases, when certain types of signals were displayed in the
       Object  window  vsim  crashed.  This only occured when the signals
       displayed were NULL arrays of records.
     * In  some  cases,  invoking  with  the -coverage switch crashed the
       simulator  during  elaboration. The crash was caused by defining a
       resolution function within an architecture.
     * Direct  instantiation  of  an entity with a scalar port or generic
       constrained by a non-locally static subtype in some cases caused a
       crash at simulation-time due to misallocation of the object's type
       descriptor by the compiler.
     * Logical operators were mistakenly defined for the predefined types
       severity_level, file_open_kind, and file_open_status.
     * There  was  a  problem  when  forcing VHDL boolean arrays with bit
       vector syntax.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0a
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.0a
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * On  win32  only,  the  simulator  crashed if the top level SystemC
       module was not exported using the SC_MODULE_EXPORT macro.
     * Restart was not supported on SystemC designs on Windows.
     * SystemC  shared  library  is  now unloaded on Windows in case of a
       Fatal  error.  The shared library will no longer be locked after a
       fatal error and write operations like sccom -link can be performed
       on  the  shared library after a fatal load error. This was a known
       defect in the 6.0 release.
     * There  was  a  problem compiling SystemC via the GUI for alternate
       libraries.
     * When  attempting  to  set  a  breakpoint  in SystemC C++ code, the
       following error was produced:
       Internal  error  in  reading  shared library information" on HP-UX
       11.11.
     * HP-UX  11.11  is now supported for SystemC. The following patch is
       required: B.11.11.0306 Gold Base Patches for HP-UX 11i, June 2003.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * VHDL  assertion settings such as suppressing a particular severity
       or  breaking  on  a severity were altering the PSL assertions. Now
       VHDL assertion setting do not affect temporal assertions.
     * The  simulator  crashed when a multiclocked assertion was disabled
       either  directly  by  the  user  or  when it hit the max fail/pass
       count.
     * Designs with PSL statements could not be checkpointed.
     * There  were  some  problems with parameterized VHDL PSL statements
       where the parameters were used in a slice range.
     * Changed  PSL  output messages to always include the start time for
       passed, failed, and covered messages.
     * If  a  design  unit  containing  assertion or cover directives was
       optimized  without the +acc=a flag, the directives were mistakenly
       allowed   to  be  added  to  the  List  and  Wave  windows.  These
       non-browseable  directives  are now prevented from being added the
       Wave or List windows.
     * A  simulation  break  occurred  at a PSL assert rather then a VHDL
       assert  even  though  PSL failure action was set to 'continue' and
       VHDL assert action was set to 'break'.
     * Sometimes  designs with PSL assertions crashed when compiling with
       vopt or vlog -fast when +acc access was disabled.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * A  multisource  interconnect delay in a mixed language design that
       traversed  multiple  levels  of  hierarchy  could  give  incorrect
       results.
     * The  vgencomp  tool  failed  to recognize explicitly typed Verilog
       parameters  and  always generated a VHDL generic type based on the
       type  of  the  initial  value  of  the  parameter  rather than the
       explicit type.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.0a
     * Windows  documents  a  list  of illegal file names that are device
       drivers.  For  the work library we map module names, entity names,
       and  architecture  names  that would become an illegal name into a
       legal name. For this release we extended the list of illegal names
       that  we  recognize  to  include  the complete list that Microsoft
       documents.  We  do  this  mapping  on  all  platforms  to create a
       portable  library  format.  This  mapping is not customer visible,
       except  that  prior  to  5.8e  a  valid  module name would fail to
       compile on Windows due to matching an illegal Windows file name.
     * If  a  memory  was  in the top level module, the memory was listed
       twice in the Memory window.
     * The  vcover  command  reported incorrect statistics in incremental
       (-incr)  mode when a subsequent data file subsumes the coverage of
       the base file.
     * With  code  coverage  turned on, condition coverage sometimes gave
       unexpected  behavior  when  variables  that took on unknown values
       were compared against literal constants.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.0a
     * DR  00210676  -  New  project 'Add Files' copy fails to update new
       location of files.
     * DR  00210930  -  ModelSim  fails  if  there  is  an  existing work
       subdirectory.
     * DR 00214728 - Cannot save dataset from Wave window.
     * ER  00178714  -  "Goto  time"  pulldown  menu  not  functioning as
       expected.
     * DR  00215713  - Modelsim 6.0 On-Line Release notes recommend wrong
       compiler.
     * DR 00213799 - ModelSim: vcom crash with "unexpected signal: 11".
     * DR 00212983 - Vgencomp problem with parameter types.
     * DR 00215967 - Modelsim 6.0 crashes with big wlf files.
     * DR 00213373 - vsim is crashing.
     * DR 00214179 - Loading on design causes crash in 6.0.
     * DR 00213886 - +opt does not work for explicitly defined libraries.
     * DR  00215903 - ModelSim GUI slow to respond with project stored on
       remote drive.
     * DR 00214574 - Losing Source Window after undocking all and Zoom.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.0a
     * The  new  (6.0)  Watch  window has a problem with the mouse cursor
       grabbing  existing  items while dragging another item over the top
       of them.
     * The  new  (6.0)  Watch  window re-arranges everything in it to the
       upper-left corner when dropping a new item in to it.
     * The new (6.0) Watch window does not allow drag and drop from other
       windows when it is undocked.
     * When  you  are  creating  a  code  coverage  exclusion  file,  the
       filenames  you  enter  must use the same paths that were given for
       the  file  to  vcom  or vlog. Otherwise you will get an error: "**
       Warning:  (vsim-3684)  File  '/u/xx/src/test.vhd'  has no coverage
       data associated with it."
     * Synopsys SmartModels can crash on the hppa64 platform.
     * Profiling  is  not  supported on the linux_x86_64 platform (64-bit
       ModelSim for the AMD Opteron) and may cause ModelSim to crash.
     * Delayed  virtual  signals, that specify the delay using pound-sign
       notation  within  the  expression,  will  not  work  correctly for
       triggering the list window. Instead, use the virtual signal -delay
       option for specifying the delay. That seems to work correctly.
     * If  you  do  a  search  in the Wave window on a bit of a multi-bit
       Verilog  register,  and  you are counting falling transitions, the
       count may be incorrect. (Transitions are counted by setting up the
       search  for  an  excessive  number of transitions, then the search
       reports the number actually found when the end of file is hit.)
     * Processing  of  the  PSL  cover  directive  will  produce too many
       matches  in  some circumstances, causing the cover count to be too
       high.  The problem occurs with coverage of sequences like {{a;b} |
       {c;d}}  or  {a[*1 to 2]; b[*1 to 2]}. In sequences like these, the
       same  sequence  for  the  same  input  at  the same start time may
       succeed  simultaneously  in  multiple ways. For example, the first
       sequence  may succeed with a and c followed on the next cycle by b
       and  d;  this  satisfies  both  the  simultaneous  {a;b} and {c;d}
       sequences.  Logically,  the  evaluation should increment the count
       once  and  only  once  for  a single directive with a given set of
       inputs from a given start time. However, in the above example, the
       Modelsim 6.0 implementation will increment the count twice.

   Product Changes to 6.0a

   New Features Added to 6.0a
     * Waveform compare was enhanced for SystemC signals and variables.
          + You  can  compare  SystemC  items to SystemC, Verilog or VHDL
            items.
          + For  pure  SystemC  compares, you can compare any two signals
            that  match  type  and size exactly; for C/C++ types and some
            SystemC  types,  sign  is ignored for compares. Thus, you can
            compare char to unsigned char or sc_signed to sc_unsigned.
          + All  SystemC  fixed-point  types  may be mixed as long as the
            total number of bits and the number of integer bits match.
       Mixed language compares are supported as follows:
       Supported C/C++ types:
          + bool
          + char, unsigned char
          + short, unsigned short
          + int, unsigned int
          + long, unsigned long
       Supported SC types:
          + sc_bit, sc_bv
          + sc_logic, sc_lv
          + sc_int, sc_uint
          + sc_bigint, sc_bituint
          + sc_signed, sc_unsigned
       Supported Verilog types:
          + net
          + reg
       Supported VHDL types:
          + bit, bit_vector
          + boolean
          + std_logic, std_logic_vector
       The  number  of  elements must match for vectors; specific indexes
       are ignored.
     * -g  no  longer  truncates  the given value to 32-bits. For example
       '-g"p=40'hffff0000xx"  will  now  properly set a Verilog parameter
       'p' to a 40-bit value.
     * A  'merge'  function  was  added  to the wlfman utility which will
       allow  different  signals from two wlf files to be merged into one
       wlf file.
     * Master  slave  library  version  2.0-MS2.0b  is now supported. The
       -scms option needs to be passed to sccom during compile and link.
     * The Wave window will now open, by default, inside the Main window.
       The  window  can  be undocked from the Main window by pressing the
       undock  button  in  the window header or by using the view -undock
       wave  command.  The preference variable PrefWave(ViewUnDocked) can
       be  used to control this default behavior. By setting the value of
       this  variable  to  1,  the  Wave  window  will open undocked. The
       temporary command view mdiwave has been discontinued.
     * A  new  set  of  'wave' commands was added to do basic Wave window
       manipulation. The wave commands include:
          + wave activatecursor
          + wave addcursor
          + wave deletecursor
          + wave cursortime
          + wave positioncursor
          + wave seecursor
          + wave seetime
          + wave zoomfull
          + wave zoomin
          + wave zoomout
          + wave zoomlast
          + wave zoomrange
       Please   see   the   Modelsim   Command   Reference  for  detailed
       descriptions of each command.
