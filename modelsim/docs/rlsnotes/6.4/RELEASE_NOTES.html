<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
Saving a wave format file (wave.do) did not always correctly save virtual signal dependencies such as virtual types or other virtual signals not in the Wave window.
</li>
<li>
When a SystemC breakpoint was hit during simulation, or if the user was doing a step operation in SystemC code, other GUI windows (e.g. Objects, Workspace, Wave, List) were not getting updated consistently with the current context.</li>
<li>
The symbolic or default radix now displays values from Verilog objects of type time as time values. 
</li>
<li>
When a non-symbolic radix was specified, the <b>examine</b> command gave different
results from those in the Wave and List windows for standard logic vectors which
contained 'H' or 'L'. The List and Wave windows (correctly) displayed 'H' as
'1' and 'L' as '0', while the <b>examine</b> command displayed them as 'X'.</li>
<li>
The Tcl command <b>info script</b> is now supported with do files.</li>
<li>
Doing text selection in the Source window was difficult when trying to begin the selection at the start of a line. Also, it was fairly easy to inadvertantly set breakpoints. The source window has been improved to display a thin vertical line which shows the boundary between the line number column and the text area. There is also an additional amount of interior padding within the text area.
</li>
<li>
Hitting F1 with the Source window active would issue an error about the help system not being loaded. This error is no longer shown, making the Source window consistent with the rest of the vsim GUI with respect to its use of F1.
</li>
<li>
The .mpf file became corrupt when the vsimk.exe process became hung and was killed.</li>
<li>
The popup menu in the library pane had choices for simulating and simulating with coverage.  The simulation choice would execute "vsim designname", so <b>-vopt</b> was on by default.  This popup is typically used with simple designs or by new users, so optimization is probably not the expected default behavior.<br><br>

The library popup has been changed to provide more flexibility.  The new popup provides these simualtion choices:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Simulate = vopt is on and -voptargs=+acc is applied for object visibility;
<LI>Simulate without Optimization = -novopt is applied;
<LI>Simulate with full Optimization = -vopt is applied;
<LI>Simulate with Coverage = -coverage is applied;
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Clicking on the icon in the upper left corner of a docked MDI window (wave, dataflow, list, etc) will now activate the window.</li>
<li>
If you have a design where the work library is mapped to somewhere other than the current working directory, when you try doing a Recompile from the library pane you will get an error reported about not being able to access "work/_info". This has been corrected.</li>
<li>
The CoverOpt level applied during vlog was lost during vopt.  For qverilog, command line option applied for CoverOpt level was lost.  In the command <b>vcom -refresh -quiet</b>, the option <b>-quiet</b> was ignored.
</li>
<li>
The menu pick File->Open has been modified when the Wave, List or Dataflow windows are active. In previous versions, when the Wave or List window was active, the "dataset open" dialog was raised. This dialog only allowed datasets (WLF files) to be opened. When other windows were active, the general open dialog was presented which allowed any file type to be opened, including a dataset. The new behavior of File->Open, when a Wave or List window is active, is to present the general open dialog. Users can still open a dataset as before, but now have the option of opening other file types as well. In addition, when a dataset is opened with File->Open, information is automatically added to the Wave window. This functionality remains unchanged with one exception. If a List window is active when the File->Open is issued, the information is added to that List window, not to a Wave window. The Dataflow window now supports File->Open. User's can access more advanced dataset operations by issuing File->Open Dataset in the Main window.
</li>
<li>
The Wave Editor produced incorrect simulation behavior. This issue has been fixed
</li>
<li>
A new dataset subcommand called <b>current</b> was added. It optionally takes a dataset nameas an argument to view the specified dataset. It prints the name of the currently viewed
dataset when no argument is specified.
</li>
<li>
Changing the current dataset in the Workspace window by clicking on a dataset name did not change the current context of the GUI, clicking on an item in the context tree was necessary to change the actual context of the GUI.<br><br>

Now the GUI context will be set to the last selected context of the dataset when a dataset becomes visible either by mouse click on dataset tabs, or, by the dataset current command. All the context dependent GUI data will be updated, and all the context dependent CLI commands will start working with respect to the new context.<br><br>

If the path argument to an env CLI command refers to a dataset which is not 
currently visible in the Workspace window, then the env command will make that dataset visible after selecting the specified context. </li>
<li>
When using analog formatting and viewing the waveform's "min/max" values in either the Wave Properties dialog or the Format > Analog (Custom) dialog, it was possible for the displayed values to appear to have rounding inprecision. For example a value of "13.0" might be displayed as "12.999999999999998". This has been fixed so the displayed values will match however they would appear in the Wave's "Value" pane.</li>
<li>
Logging a VHDL NULL array process variable to the WLF file could cause a crash when the WLF file was read in post-simulation (e.g. vsim -view vsim.wlf) or with wlfman.
</li>
<li>
System Verilog enum values that did not correspond to a defined enum (i.e. RED, BLUE, GREEN, etc) would be displayed in a hard to read format (i.e. "?(1/0)").  Now the value itself will be displayed (i.e. "1" instead of "?(1/0)" and "zzz" instead of "?(0/7)" etc).
</li>
<li>
The first paste within a source file would not result in the SAVE action becoming enabled. This has been fixed. </li>
<li>
In some cases, the color in the Wave window of a composite bus would display as red (implying an unknown member value) when all member values were known values.
</li>
<li>
It was possible for opened source files to get out of sync following a restart. An example would be that the lines identified as allowing breakpoints would not be correct. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>
The User Attributes of Verification Management windows (browser and tracker) are no longer unconditionally saved in the .modelsim file. They are only saved when any of column layouts make use of them.
</li>
<li>
Balloon help in the Wave window Messages pane did not work as expected for high zoom-in levels. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
Using the "Rescale to fit Y data" or "Show menu of other actions->View Min Y" or "Show menu of other actions->View Max Y" menu picks from the Analog sidebar menu would result in a Tcl stacktrace if there were gaps in the logged data (i.e., intervals of No_Data).</li>
<li>
Visibility column in Workspace window was showing wrong visibility for black box instances.</li>
<li>
The <b>nolog</b> command with a wildcard would cause a crash when it tried to stop logging on signals that had not been logged.
</li>
<li>
The command <b>nolog -all</b> would prevent update on some array signals.
</li>
<li>
In certain cases, the source window would not display annotated values for signals.</li>
<li>
Tracing drivers and readers of signals in the source window would not show some drivers or readers if there were implicit processes created between the signal and its driver/reader.</li>
<li>
Corrupted MPF (project) files could result in the simulator crashing. The simulator now detects the corruption, and properly reports the error.   </li>
<li>
Logging VHDL variable and generics which were NULL arrays could produce a WLF file that would cause a crash when read post-simulation with "vsim -view" or "dataset open".</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
The "reg" keyword following net_type keyword is not allowed in a net or port declaration.  The following declarations now generate syntax error: <br> wire reg r1; <br> module t(tri reg r1);</li>
<li>
A structure literal may now be passed as a parameter value to a class as in this example:
<br>
LinkedPacket #(.p1('{1,3})) Lp1=new();
<br>
A restriction still exists, in that we will print an "unsupported" error message if the type of the parameter is itself a parameter.</li>
<li>
When a concatenation of memory elements was passed to an output port in an array of instances, the port connections were not correct, resulting in incorrect simulation.  Here is an example, where 'n' was a memory array:

<br>register16 u[3:0] (.q({q,n[3],n[2],n[1]  }), .d({  n[3],n[2],n[1],d}), .*);</li>
<li>
The simulator now detects when a variable (or element) written within an 'always_comb' block is also written elsewhere outside that block, and prints an error.  This is detected by vlog when possible, or during elaboration.  In either case, the error, #7033, may be suppressed or turned into a warning using <b>-suppress 7033</b> or <b>-warning 7033</b> command-line options.</li>
<li>
For inout ports, if the port kind is omitted, then the port shall default to a net of net type wire. This means a definition such as, module top (inout integer a); is now handled as, module top (inout wire integer a);. Hence, the follow error message will no longer occur:<br>
<code>
An inout port (a) must be a net type.
</code></li>
<li>
LRM section 6.21 limits the use of elements of dynamic arrays to procedural blocks, which implies that they may not be used as port-actuals or in continuous assignments.  However, we were not catching these as errors when the references were external.</li>
<li>
Added support of 'randc' for more types, including: multi-dimension arrays, dynamic arrays, queues and parameterized types. Per mantis #2233 restrictions on allowed types for randc were removed (now allowing any integral type).
Note: randc is still not supported for associative arrays.</li>
<li>
Extended support of SystemVerilog randsequence for previously unsupported features.<br>
Randsequence now supports:
<UL> 
<LI>references to automatic or local variables, 
<LI>production return values (including multiple instances).
</UL>
Several randsequence bugs were fixed:
<UL>
<LI>problems recognizing productions depending on the order of declaration, 
<LI>problems with different randsequence statements containing productions of the same name, 
<LI>problems referring to class properties or function arguments, an error is now reported for negative production weights.
</UL>
NOTE: Due to these updates, sequences generated by a randsequence statement are different in 6.4 from those generated in 6.3 versions.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-E</b> flag would emit Verilog text without necessary spaces.
</li>
<li>
vopt now accepts VCD files that replace instances without the instance's compiled object.
</li>
<li>
Added an implementation of svGetCallerInfo(), an IEEE std 1800-2005 specified function for SystemVerilog support.
</li>
<li>
Packed, tagged unions had problems in earlier versions.  In particular, if one had a packed array of packed, tagged unions, one could not assign to an element of that array.  In addition, $display of these types did not print correct values.</li>
<li>
Unnecessarily escaped identifiers in the body of a macro now match with unescaped macro formal arguments.</li>
<li>
A clocking block declared in a nested program failed to find the signal associated with a clocking variable when the associated signal was declared outside the program block.</li>
<li>
The simulator automatically detects and applies <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> to optimized cells with negative timing checks. Appropriately applying <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> will significantly improve simulation performance. To turn off this feature, specify <b>+no_autodtc</b> to vsim.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog external method declarations using an undeclared return type gave fatal errors in some situations.
</li>
<li>
Errors occurring at the end of one Verilog file may have resulted in error messages with incorrect data.</li>
<li>
Initializing an enum value with an external reference used to produce an error during elaboration.  The following will now work, where 'str' is a parameter inside the instantiated interface:
<code>
enum8_inf i();<br>
typedef enum{zero = i.str, one , two, three} num_n;
</code>
</li>
<li>
Cases such as:<br>
<code>
module top(); <br>
</code>
<ul>
<code>
begin : <b>genblk2</b><br>
end<br>
<br>

begin<br>
end<br>
<br>

begin : <b>genblk02</b><br>
end<br>
</code>
</ul>
<code>
endmodule<br>
</code>
might have given errors such as: <br>
<code>
# ** Error: 'genblk02' already exists; must not be redefined as a generate block<br>
# vlog failed.
</code>
<br>
This is now fixed, and the second generate block will get the name '<b>genblk002</b>'.</li>
<li>
Calling super class constructor inside a member function of a derived class might have given errors like:<br>
<code>
** Error: 1.v(8): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vrslvdecl.c(6082) stmt<br>
** Error: 1.v(8): Verilog Compiler exiting<br>
</code></li>
<li>
Certain system functions, such as $unsigned and $log10, are now treated as 'constant' when their arguments are constants. Hence, these can be used for initializing parameters.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog designs with user packages named "avm_pkg" did not properly refresh.
</li>
<li>
Under some circumstances while processing an error condition in a task for function, vopt would crash.
</li>
<li>
A <b>force</b> on an unpacked wire-array did not work properly, and either resulted in an error or stored the wrong value.  The following now works correctly:<br>
<code>
reg [7:0] force_value [7:0][3:0] = '{7:'{default:3},0:'{default:9},default:1};<br>
wire [7:0] warr [7:0][3:0];<br>
initial force warr = force_value;
</code></li>
<li>
Dereferencing an element of a class through a virtual interface (i.e. "vif.clshandle.var") would result in an <code>Illegal virtual interface dereference</code> error.
</li>
<li>
An issue with Verilog incomplete pragma's was fixed.
</li>
<li>
Expressions having a mix of "real" and "reg" types produced incorrect results in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vlog <b>-lint</b> command would produce warnings for generate loops which are
valid in SystemVerilog.
</li>
<li>
A wait on the 'triggered' method of an event variable, referenced through a virtual interface, never awakened. For example:
<code>
<pr><br>   virtual task rcv();
<pr><br>
wait(bfn_port.bfn_sof_edge.triggered);  // event is never seen on wait
</code></li>
<li>
Errors would be reported by the simulator when attempting to perform restart on designs with configurations. In incremental (novopt) mode, a stacktrace would often occur. In vopt mode, when vopt is invoked automatically by the simulator (2-step flow), the simulator would report the following error:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-8345) Unable to find original top-level design units for optimized design "_opt".
</code>
</li>
<li>
Fixed 'syntax error, <code>unexpected $undefined, expecting "class"'.
</li>
<li>
Associative array methods such as 'first' and 'next' were treating the 'this' argument as a reference, when it should be treated as an input (since the array itself is not modified).</li>
<li>
Use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> caused invalid SDF annotation errors of type (vsim-SDF-3262).</li>
<li>
Using $fwrite on a packed 'struct' would cause vsim to crash.</li>
<li>
vopt would sometimes report errors as being in protected code when they were actually in public, non-encrypted code.</li>
<li>
In some cases involving extension of parameterized classes within generate conditions or when the extending class was non-parameterized, optimization or simulation could fail.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog package compilation was not respecting "-Lf" library path directives. </li>
<li>
When any of the port connections of a bind call contains concatenation
expression as an actual expression, vlog <b>-refresh</b> would somtimes result in a crash or when vsim is invoked with <b>-novopt</b>.
</li>
<li>
Simulations using pulse_e_style_ondetect could hang.</li>
<li>
An incorrect error indicating an invalid virtual method override could be generated during compilation for some cases involving methods whose types were specializations of parameterized classes.</li>
<li>
In some cases an error would not be reported if a package class was extended in a module and a virtual method was overridden by a method with incorrect types.</li>
<li>
With <b>-G</b> and <b>+acc=r</b> specified at the same time in vopt, sometimes an error message of the following form was displayed: <br>
<code>
Invalid override of parameter 'P' whose value may no longer be modified.
</code></li>
<li>
Within some contexts such as a parameterized class, an invalid error could be reported when assigning a enum value to an array of the enum type.</li>
<li>
A type error would be incorrectly reported if the value assigned to an enum variable was a conditional expression where both branches of the conditional were correctly typed enums.</li>
<li>
An invalid error was reported if the index type of an associative array was an incomplete forward type declaration.</li>
<li>
Conditional path delay selection failed to evaluate the new condition result in the case that the condition result changed simultaneous with choosing a path delay (in some cases).</li>
<li>
System Verilog <b>foreach</b> when used to iterate over an array which has its dimensions defined as an unsigned integer might have given wrong results in incremental compile mode. </li>
<li>
Using an empty string as a key into an associative array was ignored.  For example:<br>
<code>
int arr[string];<br>
string s = "";<br>
initial arr[s] = 23;<br>
</code>
Previously, 'arr' would still be empty.  It will now have an entry whose key is "" and whose value is 23.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-E</b> flag would produce incorrect output when used with full case/parallel case pragmas within comments.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
The VPI type of a variable from within an array of short real was incorrectly reported as vpiRealVar. It is now vpiShortRealVar. </li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800-2005 mentioned two callback reason definitions that are in the process of changing. cbSizeChange was referred to in the text, but not given a numeric definition; and cbTypeChange which had the numeric definition of 605 but was not referenced anywhere else.
In the sv_vpi_user.h supplied with 6.4, the cbSizeChange macro definition has the numeric value 605. cbTypeChange is left in place, but VPI application developers should not use this type label in their code, as it is now targeted for deprecation.</li>
<li>
A PLI application that directly modifies the contents of a memory using the pointer to storage obtained from tf_nodeinfo() can now propagate the changes to the design by calling tf_propagatep(). This is a non-standard extension to tf_propagatep(). Previously, there was no mechanism to propagate these changes, which could lead to confusing inconsistencies in the design state, especially in an optimized design.</li>
<li>
FLI/PLI shared libraries are now unloaded during quit unless the <b>-keeploaded</b> vsim option is used. Any atexit callback registered for the shared library is called when the shared library is unloaded. In case of a C++ shared library, global destructors are called after all the atexit() callbacks are done.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
When vcom was invoked using an older language version, newer language declarations from packages std.standard, std.textio and ieee.std_logic_1164 could (illegally) be accessed via USE clauses or selected names. An example is compiling with <b>-87</b> option and using the selected name std.standard.delay_length, which is defined
for VHDL93 and later versions.
</li>
<li>
Checking of PURE functions with regard to the rules listed in "2.2 Subprogram bodies" of the LRM has been improved.  In particular, use of FILE objects in PURE functions will be detected under more circumstances.  To enforce strict interpretation of the applicable rules, use the <b>-pedanticerrors</b> switch when invoking vcom.
</li>
<li>
The behavior of the vopt <b>+floatgenerics</b> switch has been corrected to be more closely aligned with the <b>+floatparameters</b> switch, in resolving the following issues.
<ul>
<li>The <b>+floatgenerics</b> switch would not accept instance paths that extended through generate loops which had been unrolled (internally) by vopt. If a generate loop is not unrolled, because its range cannot be determined by vopt, all iterations of the generate loop will now satisfy the associated path element, and a warning will be issued.</li>
<li>A path can now be specified in the form design-unit/instance-path.</li>
<li>Individual generics can now be named.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
When <b>-check_synth</b> is used on a VHDL design, a warning was incorrectly issued when a static attribute was referenced for a signal that was not in the sensitivity list.</li>
<li>
There were discrepancies in array return value index bounds between the VHDL function source and internal accelerated versions of some functions in package std_logic_1164.  Accelerated versions now produce results with the same array index bounds as the defining VHDL source in the package.</li>
<li>
For a FUNCTION having a return type mark that denotes a constrained array subtype, the language requirement (see 8.12 in the LRM) that a RETURN statement expression must evaluate to an array value with the same index range(s) and direction(s) as that type mark has been relaxed to produce only a compiler warning; an implicit subtype conversion will be performed at run time.  To enforce the prior compiler behavior, use the <b>-pedanticerrors</b> switch.
</li>
<li>
In some instances when a signal array appeared twice in a port map one of them was left unconnected.
</li>
<li>
For some cases where the name of a block generic is similar to the generic of the parent entity, wrong generic propagation was taking place.
</li>
<li>
An expanded name whose prefix was one of the packages in one of the libraries shipped with the product could not be used in a user-defined package of the same name.  For example, a user-defined package named "numeric_std", if it contained an expanded name "ieee.numeric_std.signed", even though legal, would cause a compiler error "Expanded name prefix cannot denote design unit being analyzed.".

<li>
In some cases when doing default binding at elaboration, if multiple entities with the same name existed in more than one library the default entity was taken from the wrong library.</li>
<li>
In some cases, a process modeling an FSM that reads a subelement of signal of a record type would not be optimized correctly and fail to execute the body on the clock edge after reaching a particular state.  
</li>
<li>
In some cases, vopt could infer incorrect values for generics, or infer none, when configurations specified bindings of distinct architectures of a single entity. If no generic values were inferred, and the entity specified no default value, the following error message would be issued:
<pre>
** Fatal: (vsim-3350) Generic '...' has not been given a value.

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
Problems existed when a hand generated component declaration was used instead
of the output from vgencomp.  The first problem was that
the component could incorrecting allow generics to be passed to Verilog parameters
that should not be accessable from VHDL. This would only work in the novopt
flow when default binding was done at elaboration time.  In the vopt flow or
when default binding was done at compile an error would be generated about
the Verilog module missing a generic. This is now an error in all flows.
The second problem was that in novopt bind at elaboration time flow it would
incorrect connect ports and generics when extended indentifiers were used.
</li>
<li>
Mapping of parameter R to generic \R\ could get confused by case differences if a parameter/generic of lowercase r exists.</li>
<li>
SystemC control/observe can now be used multiple-times on the same SystemC signal to simultaneously control and observe a bi-directional foreign signal.</li>
<li>
Unnamed VHDL instances in Verilog were not reported as an error when optimizing the design. Instead a crash would occur. </li>
<li>
vopt crashed when accessing items within a black-boxed design unit and the design was mixed-language.
</li>
<li>
The <b>vcd dumpports</b> command failed to capture "same state" contention in the VCD file on an inout port in the case of a Verilog DUT underneath a VHDL testbench. Specifically, transitions from one driver "on" to multiple drivers "on" without a state change were not recorded.</li>

<li>
A new option called <b>-version</b> is added in vcover report and merge commands
to print UCDB file version number. For merge, it will print the version number
of each input UCDB file, and the version number of the output UCDB file.

<li>
The output of the <b>vcover report -totals -byinstance</b> command is now same as the output of the <b>vcover stats</b> command.
</li>
<li>
Added option <b>-maxfecrows n</b> to set the maximum number of input patterns allowed in FEC table. The corresponding modelsim.ini variable is "CoverMaxFECRows". The default value is 192.
</li>
<li>
Added vcom/vlog option <b>-nofec</b> to disable focused expression coverage. It is enabled when <b>-cover ec</b> is used.</li>
<li>
Added a pragma "coverage never". This pragma will stop coverage instrumentation at compile time. Code excluded via this pragma can not be included during run time. This can be turned off via pragma "coverage on".</li>
<li>
Instance exclusions are applied in byfile and bydu reports for
design units having only one instance.</li>
<li>
The "Code Coverage" -> "Enable Recursive Coverage Sums" menu item is added in
Workspace popup and pulldown menus to change coverage data display in Workspace
window. By default the Workspace now displays non-recursive local coverage data. 
Selecting the above menu item will switch the display to show recursive coverage data. 
If any design unit is not compiled with cover flags then 
the coverage data will not be displayed for the instances of that design unit in both modes of view. 
The Workspace window name indicates the data display mode by showing
either "Local Coverage Aggregation" or "Recursive Coverage Aggregation" along
with the Workspace name. The last selection is saved in .modelsim file.

<li>
Fixed a bug in which generate blocks are not reported for code coverage after
restart, in no-vopt mode.</li>
<li>
The <b>-nofec</b> option in vlog and vcom was renamed to <b>-nocoverfec</b>. The CoverageFEC

<li>
Added the <b>+dumpports+nocollapse</b> vsim switch to go with (and be the opposite of) the <b>+dumpports+collapse</b> switch for controlling whether dumpport VCD vectors are collapsed or not (default is collapsed in the modelsim.ini file).
</li>
<li>
When vsim detected it needed to do an automatic refresh of a design-unit (typically when a 64-bit version was needed, when only a 32-bit version exists), there could be concurrency conflicts -- especially when multiple vsim processes were executing in a simulation grid configuration.</li>
<li>
vopt generates duplicate error messages when detecting an error on parsing mixed language options such as <b>-sdfmin</b>, <b>-sdftyp</b>, <b>-sdfmax</b>.</li>
<li>
vopt failed to execute when some pathnames contained parentheses.
</li>
<li>
Makefiles generated by vmake failed to recompile Verilog code in cases where $unit items existed because the date/time stamp on the $unit _primary.dat file was always newer than the date/time stamp on the design unit _primary.dat file.
</li>
<li>
The vmake utility now generates vlog, vcom, and vopt command lines using the original command line arguments. Previous version of vmake failed to capture some command line arguments like <b>-novopt</b> and <b>-timescale</b>.

<ul>
<li>
On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop at the breakpoint. </li>
<li>
On Windows platform, if breakpoint is set on a SystemC object destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which will prevent unloading of the shared library.</li>
<li>
Syntax highlighting may not function properly in the Source window (all the source is shown as plain text). You can fix this problem by editing ~/hte/v2_38/hte.ini (where ~ represents your "HOME" directory) and deleting the line that says:<br>
<code>
languages=cxx tcl verilog vhdl XML PSL
</code></li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
vlog will now print an "unsupported" error message for nested design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3.  This error may be suppressed using the <b>-suppress 2230</b> command-line options.</li>
<li>
For viewing events in Expanded Time in the List window, use the "configure list" command with the "-delta events" option.  "events" is added to the "all", "collapse", and "none" options for the "-delta" argument.  These options control the details shown in the List window and in writing list files.  This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.

The "write list -events" command serves a different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control Expanded Time viewing in List window.

</li>
<li>
The "examine", "searchlog", and "seetime" commands have NOT been enhanced
for use with Expanded Time.  This was documented incorrectly in the
"Expanded Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of the
"Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
</li>
<li>
Transaction streams created within System Verilog interfaces will not be visible in the GUI except in the actual interface instance.  Any formals attached to the instance will not include the TR streams.  This is by design and will be changed as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
To improve usability, the Run toolbar has been changed: a Break button has been added.
</li>
<li>
The text-based windows (Transcript, Notepad and Source) now have an "inline" search bar (instead of a dialog box) which supports incremental searching. The previous behavior can be restored using the "Main/InlineTextSearch" option.</li>
<li>
Several fatal elaboration errors will now print the line # where the error occurred.</li>
<li>
The new enhanced support of analog format within the Wave window includes a change to the output created by "write format wave". In pre-6.4 the output for the "add wave" commands would include "-offset" and "-scale". Starting in 6.4 the output will instead use "-min" and "-max".</li>
<li>
When vpi_iterate and vpi_scan are used on an array of instances, the individual elements will now be returned left-to-right, where they formerly were returned low-to-high.  For example if they are applied to "mymodule u1[2:0]();", the elements returned will be u1[2], u1[1], u1[0].</li>
<li>
Each tag in a taglist (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
VCD extensions for SystemVerilog supported as per Section 24: VCD Data in IEEE-P1800.  LRM is not extending VCD for interfaces and programs. They will be dumped as "module" scope.</li>
<li>
The source window has been changed to remove the separate column used to display breakpoints. Breakpoints will be shown within the "line number" column (as they were in the pre-6.3 releases). The LMB event handling has been improved to avoid inadvertant setting of breakpoints. Also, there is now a subtle visual separator bar between the text area and the line number column to help guide the user during text selection.</li>
<li>
The coverage numbers shown in the source window can appear to be in conflict with what's shown in the "Missed Coverage" window. This occurs when the Missed Coverage window is in "By Instance" mode and the source window is in "By File" mode. The latter is the default for the source window but it gives no indication what its current mode is. To make it clear for the user, the title bar of the source window will be enhanced to include the current coverage data mode(either "by file" or "by instance").</li>
<li>
The Contains toolbar now supports multiple wildcard modes.  The default mode is now "glob" style which is the more common form of wildcards as found in UNIX shells.  The wildcards are *, ?, [chars], and \x where x is any character, removing that character's special meaning.  

<p>Previously, this filtering tool used full regular expressions.  This option is selectable from the menu button in the Contains entry box, by selecting the value "regular-expression".</p>

<p>The third option, "exact", does not use wildcards so no characters have any special meaning.</p>

<p>In all modes, the search patterns are considered case insensitive.  If a case sensitive pattern is needed, use the regular-expression mode and perpend the search string with "(?c)".</p>

<p>The preference variable PrefMain(ContainsMode) defines the filter mode for all windows with one of the values of "glob", "regexp", or "exact".</p>

<p>More information on regular expressions can be found in the Tcl reference manual under "re_syntax".  Information on glob style matching can be found in the Tcl reference manual under the "string match" command.</p></li>
<li>
Macro arguments to Verilog and SystemVerilog macros are now expanded prior to substitution into the macro body.
 </li>
<li>
SDF annotation of RECREM or SETUPHOLD matching only a single setup/hold/recovery/removal timing check will result in a warning message.</li>
<li>
The transaction recording engine no longer issues a warning if a design attempts to record a transaction of zero length.</li>
<li>
The log and nolog commands are now supported for transaction streams of all kinds.  TR streams created through the SCV or Verilog APIs have logging enabled by default.  The rule is that a transaction will be logged in WLF if logging is enabled at the simulation time when the design calls ::begin_transaction() or $begin_transaction.  The effective start time of the transaction (the time passed by the design as a parameter to beginning the transaction) does not matter.  Thus, a stream could have logging disabled between T1 and T2 and still record a transaction in that period using retroactive logging after time T2.  A transaction is always entirely logged or entirely ignored.</li>
<li>
PSL LTL and OBE operators are now disabled by default.  Use -pslext vcom/vlog/vopt switch to enable these operators.</li>
<li>
The Win32/Win32PE platform executables (excluding vish.exe) are now linked with the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch. This switch allows an executable to allocate an extra gigabyte of process space (up to 3GB). The additional gigabyte of process space is available on Windows configurations that include the /3GB (/userva on Vista) boot switch.  Vish.exe is not linked with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE and we do not recommended that this switch be used with vish.exe.  Testing vish.exe with this switch exhibited a tendency to exceed the one GB system limitation which results in a crash.  When the simulator's GUI displays several windows with large amounts of graphical data and a full redraw occurs, a temporary surge in the allocation of system memory can cause the limit to be exceeded.
</li>
<li>
The behavior of virtual expressions has changed in a subtle way.  Normally when a virtual expression contains a relative context pathname, for example u1/x2/b, the current context would be used in order to resolve the name.  However, relative paths that started with a toplevel name would also be recognized, ignoring the current context.  This unintended behavior has been corrected so that the current context is always used to resolve a relative name.  This may cause some previously accepted virtual expressions to fail to be accepted.</li>
<li>
modules found through source library search are no longer treated by default as if they contained a `celldefine compiler directive. To obtain the old behavior, add +libcell to the vlog command line. Source library search is enabled with -v and -y compilation options.
Whether a module is considered a cell or not affects logging defaults with log -r *, coverage defaults within the module, and PLI access routines acc_next_cell and acc_next_cell_load. This change simplifies migration from other simulator products. </li>
<li>
Support for Verilog hierarchical references through VHDL design units has been
greatly improved. It is now possible for hierarchical references from a 
higher level Verilog to refer to objects in a Verilog module instantiated beneath a VHDL design unit.  In previous releases, upward references from a lower level Verilog module would only work if the target's scope was a direct parent, or a silbing that was instantiate lexially earlier in source. This restrictions are now removed. Hierarchical references that pass through a VHDL design will not work in the follow cases:
<ul>
<li> Is the target of a defparam.
<li> Used as an actual to a unconstrained VHDL port.
<li> Target of the reference is a VHDL object.
</ul></li>
<li>
A new toolbar has been added to the Wave window for access to the existing Bookmark functionality.</li>
<li>
Enabled use of the "contains" filter for the Files tab of the Workspace window.</li>
<li>
Support for some additional VPI features has been added in this release. The vpiDriver transition has been extended, and partial support for vpiContAssign objects has been added.</li>
<li>
When encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the encrypted Verilog file.
</li>
<li>
Wave searches initiated from the keyboard or toolbar buttons can now be stopped by clicking the Wave window's "Stop Wave Drawing" toolbar button or the Simulation toolbar's "Break" button.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog array manipulation methods now reflect the latest changes in the P1800 Draft5 version of the LRM, in that iteration occurs only in the top dimension of the array.  That is, the correct way to sum the elements of a 2-dimensional memory, as indicated in the LRM's example, is:
<p>
<br>logic [7:0] m [2][2] = '{ '{5, 10}, '{15, 20} };
<br>int y;
<br>y = m.sum with (item.sum with (item)); // y becomes 50 => 5+10+15+20
<p>
<br>Previously, ModelSim iterated through all the unpacked dimensions, "[2][2]" in this case.
</li>
<li>
When using C-debugger to debug quit callback functions, user needed to turn on 'stop on quit' mode. User start debugging by issuing 'quit -f' command. When simulation ends, user needed to quit C-debugger using 'cdbg quit' and then GUI using 'quit -f'. Now, Users do not need to issue extra commands at the end of the run. Simulator automatically quits C-debugger and GUI, after debugging is done and simulation has stopped running.</li>
<li>
If a VHDL signal is read during elaboration the value read may differ from value read in previous releases.  The VHDL LRM considers this illegal(Section 12.3) but tool behavior has always been to just warn and allow a value to be read. What the value read has always been undefined. Additionally previous releases allowed
functions and procedure with signal parameter to be called during elaboration. This is now illegal and reported at compile time.</li>
<li>
The menus which control the functional coverage tab display options (assertion, cover directives and functional coverage) have changed slightly.  Most significant of the changes is that each pane now has a separate control for "Show All Contexts" and "Recursive Mode" that is not shared with the other panes.  They are available with the right mouse click popup window as well as under the tool's main menu, under the "Display Options" menu pick.</li>
<li>
The <b>bp</b> command now outputs a list of existing C breakpoints with their enabled/disabled states in the <b>bp</b> command syntax, so that this output can be saved and executed later to recreate the breakpoints. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.4</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for enums and records (including nested records) at the SystemC-VHDL mixed language boundary.</li>
<li>
Added support for SystemC signal arrays at SystemC-SystemVerilog and SystemC-VHDL mixed language boundaries.</li>
<li>
Added support for sc_fixed types (sc_fix, sc_fixed_fast, sc_fixed, sc_fix_fast) at the SystemC-SystemVerilog mixed language boundary.
</li>
<li>
Added support for VHDL enums and records (including nested records) in scgenmod.</li>
<li>
Added support for real/shortreal as field types for structures at the SystemC-SystemVerilog mixed language boundary.</li>
<li>
Added support for VHDL constants for port connections at the VHDL-SystemC mixed
language boundary (Specifically the case where a VHDL module instantiates a
SystemC module).</li>
<li>
Support for SystemVerilog include files specified with angled brackets has been implemented as in IEEE 1800-2005 section 23.3.
</li>
<li>
In the case of task and function prototypes, unnamed formals are supported.
</li>
<li>
Added a utility program to automatically generate SCV extensions for any given type.<br>

SCV extensions can now be automatically generated by invoking sccom with the <b>-dumpscvext</b> command line option on a .cpp file which defines a global variable for each type and includes the header file containing definitions of these types.
</li>
<li>
Source annotation is now supported for SystemC. A new compiler option <b>-nodbgsym</b> has been added to sccom to stop generating the symbols debugging database in the library.
</li>
<li>
The Call Stack GUI window feature is now supported in C Debug mode.
</li>
<li>
In SystemVerilog, 'extern' tasks and functions in interfaces are now supported.
</li>
<li>
SignalSpy has been enhanced to support SystemVerilog types and user-defined SystemC types. The following new types are now supported:
<ol>
<li>SystemVerilog types:
<ul>
<li>All scalar and integer SV types (bit, logic, int, shortint, longint, integer, byte, both signed and unsigned variations of these types)
<li>Real and Shortreal
<li>User defined types (packed/unpacked structures including nested structures, packed/unpacked unions, enums)
<li>Arrays and Multi-D arrays of all supported types
</ul>
<li>SystemC types:
<ul>
<li>Primitive C floating point types (double, float)
<li>User defined types (structures including nested structures, unions, enums)
</ul>
</ol>
Cross-language type-checks and mappings have been implemented to support these types across all the possible language combinations:
<ol>
<li>SystemC-SystemVerilog
<li>SystemC-SystemC
<li>SystemC-VHDL
<li>VHDL-SystemVerilog
<li>SystemVerilog-SystemVerilog
</ol>
In addition to referring to the complete signal, the user has also been provided the flexibility of referring to the signal by bit-selects, field-selects or part-selects of the supported types (e.g. /top/myInst/my_record[2].my_field1[4].my_vector[8]).</li>
<li>
The XML Import utility (xml2ucdb) now supports a <b>-excelsheet &lt;sheet-name&lg;</b> option on the command line. This option internally modifies the extraction parameters (using pseudo-Xpath syntax) to selectively extract data from one of several worksheets in an Excel spreadsheet file.
</li>
<li>
The user can choose to display a SystemVerilog or SystemC enum as a number rather than string.  This can be done by using the radix command's <b>-enumnumeric</b> option.  The default radix controls the actual value displayed of the enum.  In case the default radix is "ASCII", the value of a SystemVerilog or SystemC enum is still displayed as a string.  Otherwise it is printed as a hex, decimal, octal, or binary number.
<br><br>
The <b>-enumnumeric</b> option of radix is stored in a Tcl variable DefaultRadixFlags.  Currently, we support only the enumnumeric option in DefaultRadixFlags, but we can easily extend this to support any other radix flag.  The user can set or reset these flags using the radix command.
<br>
<code>
VSIM> radix hex
hexadecimal<br>
VSIM> radix enumnumeric<br>
hexadecimal enumnumeric<br>
VSIM> radix binary<br>
binary enumnumeric<br>
VSIM> radix enumsymbolic<br>
binary<br>
</code>
<br>
The <b>examine</b> command takes two more options: <b>-radixenumnumeric</b> and <b>-radixenumsymbolic</b>.  These options override the global setting of default_radix. 
<br><br>
In the Wave, List and Watch windows, the user can change the radixenum property of an individual element.
</li>
<li>
SystemC control/observe enhanced to support the following:
<ul>
<li>Complex VHDL types like records (including nested records), arrays and enums.
<li>SystemVerilog structures with fields of type real/shortreal.
<li>part-selects of HDL vector types and field-selects of HDL user-defined types (VHDL records and SystemVerilog structures/unions).
</ul></li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed language boundary was enhanced to support the following VHDL types:
<ul>
<li>real & shortreal
<li>enum
<li>multi-dimentional arrays
<li>records with fields of type integer, real, enum, multi-d arrays
<li>nested records
<li>unconstrained arrays
<li>std_logic_vector/bit_vector connected to SystemVerilog packed structure
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Enhanced SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed language boundary to support the
following:<br>
<ol>
<li>SystemVerilog ports of type struct in array of instances
(Specific case where a VHDL module is instantiated in a SystemVerilog
array of instances).</li>
<li>Negative indices for fields of SystemVerilog structures of type
vector (e.g. bit [-31:0]data).</li>
<li>Range checks and support for ranged VHDL types.</li>
<li>Adding appropriate range to types in the generated VHDL packages.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
Verilog type 'real' supported at Verilog-VHDL and Verilog-SystemC mixed language boundaries. This is appropriate only for the case where a Verilog module is instantiating VHDL or SystemC, and not vice versa.</li>
<li>
Added support for Net types (wire &lt;type&gt;) at the SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed language boundary.</li>
<li>
The extended <b>step</b> command now allows the following:
<UL>
<LI>Step out of the current function or procedure and return to caller.
<br>
<code>
step -out
</code>
<br>
<LI>For SystemVerilog Classes step in only when the "this" value is equal to specific handle. The handle value can be obtained using the <b>examine -handle</b> command.
<br>
<code>
step -this "this==&lt;class handle&gt;"
</code>
<br>
<LI>Step in specific instance, process or thread.
<br>
<code>
step -inst &lt;full path name&gt;
</code>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Setting Constructor and Destructor breakpoints on SystemC/C++ objects are now supported in C Debug. Please refer to User's Manual (Chapter 8) for details on usage flow.
</li>
<li>
We now support "extern interface" declarations.</li>
<li>
Added support for structures with members of SystemC types across the SC/SV func call interface (DPI-SC).</li>
<li>
The option <b>-nocellnet</b> was added to the vsim <b>power add</b> command.
When this option is specified, vsim will not monitor any cell-net for toggling or any other power related activity.
</li>
<li>
The Auto-Library-Step-Out feature has been added in C Debug. It lets users automatically step out from the OSCI library functions. If users try to step inside the OSCI library functions, C Debug will automatically step out to the last called user function. This feature can be turned off by executing the command <b>cdbg allow_lib_step on</b>.
</li>
<li>
C Debug has added functionality to debug Active/Suspended SystemC threads. Users can now switch to any suspended SystemC thread, and view its contents like call stack, local variables, and source code. Users can debug suspended threads these cases:
<OL>
<LI>when simulation is running
<LI>when simulation has stopped at a breakpoint in an active SystemC/HDL thread
</OL>
</li>
<li>
Added support for dotstar (.*) port connections at SystemVerilog-VHDL and SystemVerilog-SystemC mixed-language boundaries.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog $exit is now supported.
</li>
<li>
Add support for SystemVerilog anonymous program blocks.</li>
<li>
Support for SystemVerilog Signal Aliasing has been added. The specification for this feature is included in, IEEE 1800-2005 Section 6.8. 
</li>
<li>
Cursors within the Wave window can now be "linked" together. This allows moving one cursor and having other cursors within the window move by the same amount of time. Access to the functionality is done via a cursor's popup menu by using the new "Cursor Linking" menu.</li>
<li>
The VPI object model support in this release still defaults to the superset of the 2005 Verilog and System Verilog standards. However, some VPI features that will be available in the 2008 standard have been introduced. Specifically, the 2008 standard identifies the five VPI object model revisions by the strings below.
<pre>
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v1995
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v2001
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v2005
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1800v2005
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1800v2008
</pre>
and these strings are now recognized both on the command line and in modelsim.ini when setting the VPI version. The simulator also accepts the following synonyms:
<pre>
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v1995 (1995, 95, 1364v1995, 1364V1995, VL1995)
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v2001 (2001, 01, 1364v2001, 1364V2001, VL2001)
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1364v2005 (1364v2005, 1364V2005, VL2005)
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1800v2005 (2005, 05, 1800v2005, 1800V2005, SV2005)
VPI_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION_1800v2008 (2008, 08, 1800v2008, 1800V2008, SV2008)
</pre>

Messages use these strings to identify versions, where applicable, too. Recognition of the user request does not imply full implementation at this time. Not all of these versions are fully supported.</li>
<li>
The simulator is now integrated with Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) Library, Release 2.0 Draft 2 Kit of 29 Nov 2007.</li>
<li>
Added the <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> sub-commands to the <b>power</b> command. The behavior is
similar to <b>vcd dumpon</b> and <b>vcd dumpoff</b>. When <b>power off</b> is called for any
signal then the toggling activity of that signal is ignored until 
<b>power on</b> is called.
</li>
<li>
Amapping for VHDL library floatfixlib has been added to modelsim.ini</li>
<li>
The <b>radix define</b> command has been enhanced to accept an optional color in the enumeration map.  The option <b>-color &lt;color-spec&gt;</b> may be added at the end of number pattern, label pair.  This color is used for the wave form and text in the Wave window.  The following example illustrates how to specify the color:
<pre>
    radix define States {
        11'b00000000001 "IDLE" -color yellow,
        11'b00000000010 "CTRL" -color #ffee00,
        11'b00000000100 "WT_WD_1" -color orange,
        11'b00000001000 "WT_WD_2" -color orange,
        11'b00000010000 "WT_BLK_1",
        11'b00000100000 "WT_BLK_2",
        11'b00001000000 "WT_BLK_3",
        11'b00010000000 "WT_BLK_4",
        11'b00100000000 "WT_BLK_5",
        11'b01000000000 "RD_WD_1" -color green,
        11'b10000000000 "RD_WD_2" -color green,
        -default hex
        -defaultcolor white
    }
</pre>

If a pattern/label pair does not specify a color, the normal Wave window colors will be used.  If the value of the wave form does not match any pattern, then the <b>-default radix</b> and <b>-defaultcolor</b> will be used.<br>
To specify a range of values, wildcards may be specified for bits or characters of the value.  The wildcard character is '?', similar to the iteration character in a Verilog UDP, for example:<br>
<pre>
    radix define {
        6'b01??00 "Write" -color orange,
        6'b10??00 "Read" -color green
    }
</pre>
In this example, the first pattern will match "010000", "010100", "011000", and "011100".  In case of overlaps, the first matching pattern is used, going from top to bottom.
</li>
<li>
Support for generics of type std_logic_vector, bit_vector, std_logic, bit, vl_logic and vl_logic_vector has been added at the Verilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary. This support is enabled by default for parameters declared in ANSI style. A command line option has been added in vlog to enable this support for other parameters (if ANSI style parameter declaration is missing).</li>
<li>
Instantiation of optimized designs (i.e. "black boxes") now does NOT require that vopt be run on the design roots.</li>
<li>
A new command has been added, <b>write format restart</b>. This command will create a single .do file that will recreate all Wave, List, Source windows, and all bp and signal (when) breakpoints.
<br>
Also, there is a new modelsim.ini setting, ShutdownFile, which, if set, will call the <b>write format restart</b> command upon exit.  This variable should be set to the name of the file to be written, or the value "--disable-auto-save" to disable this feature. If the filename contains the pound sign character (#), then the filename will be sequenced with a number replacing the #. For example, if the file is "restart#.do", then the first time it will create the file "restart1.do" and the second time it will create "restart2.do", etc.
</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog bind construct can now be used to bind to SystemC target scopes. <br>There exists certain restrictions on actual expressions that are supported. If the target of bind is a SystemC module or an instance of a SystemC module, expressions and literals are not supported as actuals. These include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li> bitwise binary expressions using operators &, |, ~, ^ and ^~
<li> concatenation expression
<li> bit select and part select expressions
<li> variable/constant 
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Enhanced scgenmod to support the following:

<ul>
<li> VHDL records with fields of type multi-dimensional arrays.
<li> SystemVerilog structures with fields of type multi-dimensional arrays.
<li> VHDL/SystemVerilog ports of type (multi-dimensional arrays). These will get converted to SystemC signal arrays in the generated foreign module declaration.
</ul></li>
<li>
The <b>-ka</b> switch has been added to vopt.  Short for "keep alternate" this switch informs vopt that it should attempt to preserve an existing 32-bit version of an optimized design if compiling using a 64-bit version of vopt (and vice versa).
</li>
<li>
Macros with default parameters are now supported as per Mantis item 1571.</li>
<li>
Automatic variables are now supported within <code>initial</code>, <code>always</code> and <code>final</code> blocks in SystemVerilog code.</li>
<li>
The following new options for the <b>coverage exclude</b> command have been added:<br
<ul>
<li><b>-pragma</b><br>
Pragma exclusions are defined as
<ul>
<li>'coverage off' for statements, branches, expressions, and conditions
<li>'coverage fsm_off' for FSM
<li>'coverage toggle_ignore' for toggles
</ul>
Pragma exclusions can be enabled/disabled using the option.
If the option is specified, both user and pragma exclusions are applied. If the option is not specified, pragma exclusions are not affected.
<li><b>-if</b><br>
If the option is specified, only the if parts of if-else branch exclusions are modified.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Support for SystemVerilog Case...Inside. IEEE 1800-2005 Section 10.4 was added.
</li>
<li>
Incremental compilation/linking support has been added for SystemC. A new command-line option, <b>-incr</b>, has been added in sccom to facilitate this support. Please refer to the User's Manual for more details.</li>
<li>
The <b>bp</b> command (file/line breakpoints) now accepts an optional label (-label). This label can be used with the <b>bd</b> (breakpoint delete), <b>enablebp</b> (enable breakpoint point), and <b>disablebp</b> (disable break point) commands. If a new breakpoint is created using a label already in use by an existing breakpoint, the older breakpoint is deleted. Labels used in both file and signal breakpoints must be unique. In other words, a file breakpoint cannot use the same label as a signal breakpoint.</li>
<li>
The "+" and "-" functions in the VHDL standard developers kit packages std_regpak and synth_regpak have been accelerated. The default is to use the accelerated versions.
</li>
<li>
Added support for ports of SystemVerilog datatypes while binding to VHDL target scopes. The following SystemVerilog data-types are now supported:<br>

<ul>
<li> integer data types (shortint, int, byte, bit, logic, reg, integer) 
<li> real and shortreal data types 
<li> enums (restricted to 2-state 32-bit base types only) 
<li> structures (packed, unpacked, including nested structures) 
<li> multi-d arrays (of all supported types)
</ul>

These data-types follow the same type-mapping rules as are followed at the SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary for direct instantiation.<br>

Actual expressions are not supported yet for these types. Please refer to the User's Manual for more details.</li>
<li>
The Verilog assign and deassign procedural statements are supported for library cell optimization.
</li>
<li>
Compiled SDF can now be annotated to Verilog and VHDL regions. This also applies to Verilog and VHDL regions that are underneath SystemC modules. However, compiled SDF cannot be targeted to a SystemC node directly (even if the intended annotation objects underneath the SystemC node are Verilog and/or VHDL).
</li>
<li>
The UI registration calls (e.g. $ui_VVInstallInst()) used by verification packages such as AVM or OVM, can be controlled using the CLI command ui_VVMode or modelsim.ini file variable UI_VVMode.  This mode control can disable this feature altogether, enable the context registration, or enable context registration and automatic logging.  The corresponding mode values are "off", "nolog", and "full", respectively.</li>
<li>
A Virtual Signal Builder dialog box has been added. The dialog can be accessed from the Tools menu in the Wave window. Please refer to the User's Manual for more information.</li>
<li>
Added [vopt] section in modelsim.ini file.  The ZeroIn modelsim.ini variable replaces VlogZeroIn/VcomZeroIn/VoptZeroIn/VsimZeroIn modelsim.ini variables.</li>
<li>
Now for CLI commands, the objects (signals, nets, etc) provided as arguments are also learned into OCF/ACC files.</li>
<li>
vlog now contains a new switch <b>-Epretty</b> which is similar to <b>-E</b>, yet provides some formatting of the output.
</li>
<li>
The 'size' method is now supported for associative arrays, and returns the number of elements, just as the 'num' method does.</li>
<li>
A new Processes window has been added with the following features:
<ul>
<li>Different view modes: active, design or in_region
<li>design mode is intended for primary navigation of ESL designs
<li>Recursive or non-recursive view in in_region mode 
<li>View processs state and type information   
<li>View processs execution order number in the active kernel queue 
<li>Filter process view based on states and types   
<li>Different sort modes for the processes 
<li>View process name with or without full context name 
<li>Get textual report of processes in the Processes window 
<li>Set a process in 'ready' state as next active process 
</ul>
Please refer to Users Manual (Chapter 2) for more information.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage exclude -scope</b> command is now accepting generate blocks.</li>
<li>
$clog2 is now allowed within a constant expression.</li>
<li>
The Wave window has a new feature called "Expanded Time" which allows expanding in the horizontal direction to see the details of value changes.  In Expanded Time Deltas Mode, the user can see the delta cycle on which an event occurred.  Previously, this type of detail was only available in the List window.  In Expanded Time Events Mode, the user can see the exact order in which each event occurred within a simulation time step.  (The event level details are now also available in the List window with the "-deltas events"  option to the "configure list" command.) The detail of this feature are in the "Expanded Time in the Wave and List Windows" section of the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the "User's Manual".</li>
<li>
Covergroups may now be linked to testplan sections via "backlinking". A comment string is added to the "option.comment" or "type_option.comment" of a covergroup, coverpoint, or cross with the following format: "tplanref=<testplantag>", using a testplan tag that exists in an imported testplan. When the design coverage is merged with the testplan (by "vcover merge"), the functional coverage item will be linked to the testplan section with a matching tag.
</li>
<li>
Some nets (e.g. clock) in a design can have many readers.  This can cause a dataflow display to draw numerous processes that you do not want to see when expanding the clock signal.  Dataflow now tests for the number of readers to be drawn and compares them to a limit that you set in Dataflow Preferences (outputquerylimit).  The default value of this limit is 100 (the test is not done if you set outputquerylimit to 0).

If this limit is exceeded, a dialog box asks whether you want the readers to be drawn. Note that this test does not affect the number of drivers that are drawn.</li>
<li>
When assertions fire with failure messages, the assertion browser now displays the name and fail count in red, both during simulation and in post-simulation mode.</li>
<li>
The assertion browser gui now supports the display of assertion directives in hierarchical (tree) form along with the current flattened form.  It can be enabled or disabled by selecting the menu pick "Display Options -> Hierarchy Mode" that can be found with the right mouse popup menu and the main assertion pulldown menu.</li>
<li>
FSM diagrams can now be viewed and debugged in the FSM window.  You can see the current and previous states highlighted as the simulation is running.  Previously, only state coverage was shown in the FSM window.  Details on how to use this feature are described in the user's manual.
