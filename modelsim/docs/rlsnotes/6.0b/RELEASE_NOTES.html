<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>64-bit ModelSim is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.8x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the ModelSim User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 6.0b
release. If you are migrating to the 6.0b release from 6.0x, 5.8x or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x and 5.8x release notes for product changes and new features introduced during the 6.0x and 5.8x releases. The previous version release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2.  The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2.  If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.  If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU zip format (.gz).  Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).  ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system version and C++ compiler version.  The OS support is slightly different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches -87, -93, or -2002, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator produced a TCL error after migrating project file from 5.8 to 6.0.</li>
<li>
Improper behavior in Modelsim 6.0 while changing Project Settings.</li>
<li>
The new Watch window did not allow drag and drop from other windows when it was undocked.</li>
<li>
Ports of a System Verilog interface instantiated multiple times in a module were only logged for the first instance of the interface.</li>
<li>
The new Watch window had a problem with the mouse cursor grabbing existing items while dragging another item over the top of them.</li>
<li>
A warning was not issued when ignoring nested <b>startup</b> commands.</li>
<li>
An uninformitive error message was issued when trying to load a coverage database (Tools->Code Coverage->Load) and no design is loaded.</li>
<li>
The new Watch window moves any objects to the upper-left corner when dropping a new object into it.</li>
<li>
Auto scroll was not implemented in the compile order window.</li>
<li>
The Restart button in the Restart dialog was bound with the Return Key to improve ease of use.</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window had problems with copy, paste and drag and drop operations between two Dataflow windows. </li>
<li>
The following changes were made regarding Preferences:<br>
<UL>
<li>The Save Preferences option no longer exists preferences are saved by default when exiting.</li>
<li>The Source window preferences dialog was merged with the main preferences dialog.</li>
<li>PrefSource is obsolete.</li>
<li>The PrefSource(Editor) was replaced by the PrefMain(Editor).</li>
</UL></li>
<li>
A Dataflow window with an embedded Wave window failed to update on selection if the design unit name contained escaped extended identifiers.</li>
<li>
The Find function in the Source window failed to search for strings that started with a dash "-".</li>
<li>
The Find function in the Source and Transcript windows did not highlight the text until you closed the find dialog.</li>
<li>
A file's status in the Project window was not updated if the file was edited externally. If a file within a project is changed outside of Modelsim, the status icon now correctly reflects the change.</li>
<li>
The wordsperline option for <b>mem save</b> is now supported in the GUI. The Memory Save dialog has an entry for Line Wrap to support this.</li>
<li>
The behavior of the column separators in the Wave window was changed to behave more like columns in other parts of the product.  For example, dragging the separator between the name and value columns to the right will push the value column to the right rather than shrinking it.</li>
<li>
PSL is now supported in projects. Click the "PSL File..." button in the Verilog or VHDL compile options dialog to add PSL files.</li>
<li>
Changing the waveform colors of PSL directives was not allowed.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with the <b>readers</b> command in handling extended identifiers.</li>
<li>
Drag and drop from Source window to Wave or List windows did not work.</li>
<li>
ModelSim issued an error message during invocation if there was no printer installed.</li>
<li>
The "Save" menu of Memory window was changed to "Save As...".</li>
<li>
The "Functional Coverage" and "Assertion" menus under View -> Debug Windows were disabled in ModelSim PE since these features are not supported in that product.</li>
<li>
The "Functional Coverage" and "Assertions" menus were removed from File -> New -> Windows to be consistent with the new MDI layout.</li>
<li>
The toggle coverage node count as displayed in the Objects window and coverage reports did not correlate to the numbers reported in the Structure window.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>-incr</b> switch had no effect when the <b>+opt</b> option was given to vlog (it worked properly in 5.8).</li>
<li>
$display and related system tasks were made to be re-entrant.
This allows $display to have a function as an argument where
the function itself calls $display.</li>
<li>
$fclose() system task had accepted (with unpredictable results) or given very general error messages with the syntax $fclose("filename").  ModelSim now detects string as argument to $fclose() and reports it as error vsim-3562.</li>
<li>
In some situations a delay solution was not found for 3-way dependencies between negative timing checks.</li>
<li>
Using the <b>-g</b> option to specify an integer value for a parameter that was defined as type real caused the parameter to be incorrectly set.
</li>
<li>
vsim could corrupt memory when a module with more than 50 ports was instantiated with fewer connections. </li>
<li>
Multiple packed dimensions were mistakenly allowed. A crash occurred at run time  if <b>-fast</b> was used. This is now flagged as an error at compile time.</li>
<li>
In some cases System Verilog class method calls were incorrectly reporting an error that the target method could not be found.</li>
<li>
A SystemVerilog for loop variable declaration was allowed without initialization which is illegal. For example: for (int i; ...) was allowed but is illegal. for (int i = 0; ..) is the correct syntax.
</li>
<li>
Incorrect output was produced in some cases when Div and Rem operators were used with a 32-bit negative divisor and the result was unsigned. </li>
<li>
Using an indexed part select inside of a loop could give
incorrect results when optimization was turned off (e.g. coverage enabled).
</li>
<li>
A signed value assigned to a sized unsigned parameter was not sign-extended to the width of the parameter.
</li>
<li>
Calling a system task that modifies its argument with an automatic variable was corrupting memory if the automatic variable had a parameterized range.</li>
<li>
Compile and elaboration performance issues related to very long concatenations were resolved.</li>
<li>
Verilog configurations could not resolve instance arrays that where configured to load a configuration.
</li>
<li>
Illegal upwards defparams that cross generate or instance array boundaries
are now reported as errors.</li>
<li>
Wildcard use in an always block sensitivity list (i.e. always @*) now will handle references to hierarchies.</li>
<li>
The system tasks $readmemh and $readmemb used to report an error when called with a memory that was either an automatic variable or a System Verilog class property.</li>
<li>
$signed(w) and $unsigned(w) always returned 0 when "w" was a scalar net.
</li>
<li>
VHDL generics could not be set from Verilog instantiations using named parameters if the generics were extended identifiers.</li>
<li>
In some cases function enables with other function enable expression arguments incorrectly evaluated the nested function return values.</li>
<li>
Use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> with negative timing check limit values  caused erroneous hold violations in certain cases.</li>
<li>
In some cases delay net delay solutions for negative timing check limits were being miscalculated and created bad "No solution found" warnings.</li>
<li>
Use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> disabled the <b>-extend_tcheck_data_limit/-extend_tcheck_ref_limit</b> feature in certain cases.</li>
<li>
Multisource interconnect delays from an inout port to an inout port were not handled correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
PLI routine tf_getp() did not get the correct value for the two-state SystemVerilog type int.</li>
<li>
vpi_handle_by_name did not handle escaped identifiers correctly when the identifier was a level of hierarchy in a hierarchical path.</li>
<li>
Error message PLI-3691 for system functions used as tasks was changed to be a warning.</li>
<li>
When using <b>-v2k_int_delays</b>, acc_handle_simulated_net crashed or
produced incorrect results for vector wires of unconnected ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The VHDL compiler crashed when defining an object of array type with index subtype that was a resolved (but unconstrained) subtype of enumeration type.</li>
<li>
ModelSim failed to recreate some VHDL output files when a simulation was started from an elaboration file or a checkpoint. The following conditions were necessary to cause the problem:
<UL>
<LI>The VHDL files were openned for write but never written to. 
<LI>A sufficient number of files were opened, in any mode, which caused Modelsim to try and share file handles. By default, the number of files is 40.
</UL></li>
<li>
If the simulator resolution limit was specified in the modelsim.ini file using
spaces between the integer value and the unit name, then the default value
of 1ns was used instead of the specified value. For example, although 100ps was
treated correctly, 100 ps was not.</li>
<li>
An internal error could be reported in some cases when generating debug information for certain subtypes. The internal error is of the form:
"Internal error: ../../../src/vcom/allocate.c(928) regions"</li>
<li>
Predefined attribute 'VALUE and package TEXTIO procedure READ(REAL) in certain cases returned inaccurate results when parsing floating point values with many digits. The behavior of these routines was modified to be the same as the floating point literal parser of vcom.</li>
<li>
The package TEXTIO procedure READ(INTEGER) erroneously considered a '.' (decimal point) to be part of the string representation of an INTEGER value,
which resulted in an error when the value was converted to INTEGER. Now when a '.' is encountered it is not consumed in the scan.</li>
<li>
Memory corruption occurred if subelement association was used for a signal parameter in a function or procedure call. The memory corruption potentially resulted in a crash with a truncated stacktrace and incorrect values for local variables.
</li>
<li>
In some case, VHDL signals that are arrays and have two or three elements
of std_logic, and are assigned to with a non-zero delay, leaked memory.
If the simulation ran long enough it consumed all memory and crashed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The vsim <b>-foreign</b> switch did not properly handle quoted pathnames. It now supports pathnames with or without quotes; both double-quotes ("") and braces ({}) may be used to quote the pathname. Quoting is necessary if the path contains spaces. For example:<BR>
<code>
    -foreign "initFunction {c:/program files/iplib/lib.dll}; parameter"<BR>
    -foreign "initMyFLI \"/home/my design/flilibs/arch.so\"; 72"<BR>
</code>
Note: the backslash escape characters are necessary to get the quote (") character past the shell.</li>

<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Initial value of the sc_signal "sig" inside sc_clock was not correct when the clock started with a negedge.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with scgenmod and std_ulogic type.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with SystemC-Verilog mixed-language value propagation.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed during post simulation waveform activity with a SystemC design having long signal names.</li>
<li>
SystemC master slave header files contained assert statements which caused the simulator to crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="psldefects"></a><b>PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Use of 2-state Verilog variables in PSL expressions resulted in undeterministic behavior. When the engine was reading the variable value directly from the kernel instead of the quad, it was assuming the value to be 4-state.</li>
<li>
vlog crashed when attempting to compile a PSL property with the "forall" operator.  An error message is now displayed that informs the user that the "forall" operator is not supported in this release.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with parameter resolution checking for VHDL expressions passed into parameterized properties.</li>
<li>
Added a time unit specifier to the start time values in logged messages for PSL and functional coverage records.</li>
<li>
Transitions to or from states "X" and "Z" were handled incorrectly for PLS rose/fell functionality. Only 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0 transitions should be allowed.</li>
<li>
Sequence 'and' either crashed or produced incorrect results in some cases.</li>
<li>
Asynchronous builtins (onehot, onehot0, isunknown, and countones) gave incorrect results when used in a synchronous expression.</li>
<li>
Sere 'intersect' gave incorrect results with time-shifts or zero-delay repeats.</li>
<li>
Non-consc and next-event sere repeats worked incorrectly at the end of simulation.</li>
<li>
Properties with [*] on the right side of an implication property failed.</li>
<li>
PSL builtin function prev(sig, N) did not work correctly when N was '0'. The expression 'prev(sig, N)' is equivalent to 'sig' itself ( i.e., an expression a && prev(b, 0) <=> a && b).</li>
<li>
wlfman was incorrectly printing the PSL directive's type as "Verilog Unknown".
Now it is printing "PSL <Assertion|Cover|Endpoint> <Verilog|VHDL>".</li>
<li>
It was difficult to see the assertion fail indicators when there were many
assertion pass indicators in a simulation session. The assertion fail indicators are now taller than the assertion pass indicator in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
vcom crashed for parameterized endpoint sequences when using the same signal as the clock expression of the endpoint.</li>
<li>
There was a difference in count values between the functional coverage browser display and the functional coverage waveform display in count mode.</li>
<li>
Property 'never' behaved incorrectly when it was not a top-level property.
</li>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Loading a design after a previous load failed resulted in a crash for designs containing simple flip flops in multiple design units.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The 64-bit version of vsim for HP-UX was not built with the
thread library enabled (like the 32-bit version).</li>
<li>
ModelSim did not produce a warning when it was unable to write to a VCD file. Now an assertion failure is generated.</li>
<li>
The <b>vcover report</b> command failed to report on instances that were not
leaf instances.</li>
<li>
64-bit sunos5v9 vsim crashed while loading a design if run with unlimited stack size (set by the limit or ulimit shell command) on Solaris 8 or later.
</li>
<li>
An environment variable was not expanded when a command line argument file (specified with the <b>-f</b> option) contained an additional <b>-f</b> option and the subsequent path contained an environment variable.</li>
<li>
On some versions of Linux when the vish process exited it generated a message like the following in the /var/log/messages file:<BR>
Nov  3 15:32:56 alias kernel: application bug: vlm(10430) has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN but calls wait().
Nov  3 15:32:56 alias kernel: (see the NOTES section of 'man 2 wait'). Workaround activated.<BR>
In some kernel versions the vish process would then fail to exit.</li>
<li>
Restoring a checkpoint file or an elaboration file did not correctly restore system file handles for VHDL user files which had been opened more than once.  Instead of sharing a single system file handle, multiple file handles were created resulting in strange and unpredictable output to the file.</li>
<li>
If a relative pathname was used when defining the MODELSIM environment variable, the following error occurred:<BR>
** Warning: (vish-14) Failed to open "./modelsim.ini" specified by the MODELSIM environment variable. Using "modelsim.ini" instead"<BR>
Relative paths are now supported.</li>
<li>
During design elaboration, if one level of hierarchy failed to find some of its instantiated design units (error vsim-3033), later levels did not try to load their instantiated design units. This suppressed helpful error messages which were produced by earlier versions of the simulator.
</li>
<li>
In vcd2wlf, changed missing upscope declarations from a fatal message to a warning message.</li>
<li>
A <b>restart</b> during code coverage caused a simulator crash in certain cases.</li>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>examine -expr</b> will fail if the expression contains an unlogged signal
because it is evaluated using the wlf file rather than direct communication
with the ModelSim kernel.</li>
<li>
Condition coverage and Expression coverage UDP tables will not show full
coverage if the condition or expression is not logically reduced.</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage information is only printed by the <b>coverage report</b>
command when the <b>-instance</b> option is used. This gives a summary of the
signals associated with the instance. To get an itemized listing of the
signals, the <b>-lines</b> option is also required. Toggle information is
not printed on file-based reports because signals are associated with
instances, not with files.</li>
<li>
Synopsys SmartModels can crash on the hppa64 platform. This is a SmartModel issue that is being addressed by Synopsys.</li>
<li>
Delayed  virtual  signals, that specify the delay using pound-sign
notation  within  the  expression,  will  not  work  correctly for
triggering the list window. Instead, use the virtual signal <b>-delay</b>
option for specifying the delay. That seems to work correctly.</li>
<li>
If  you  do  a  search  in the Wave window on a bit of a multi-bit
Verilog  register,  and  you are counting falling transitions, the
count may be incorrect. (Transitions are counted by setting up the
search  for  an  excessive  number of transitions, then the search
reports the number actually found when the end of file is hit.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Toggle coverage has been changed to no longer record transitions from U
and transitions to and from X. This allows transitions to and from Z to
be unambiguous, instead of mixed with X transitions, which may not be
physical.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage report</b> command has been changed to make the branch 
computations more compatible with industry expectations. </li>
<li>
Save Format and Save Wave Edit commands for the Wave Window have been merged together under Save.  The option is presented to save one or the other or both in the same file.
</li>
<li>
Changes have been made in the creation and processing of code coverage UDP truth
tables for condition and expression coverage. Optimizations have been added that
reduce redundant rows, sometimes caused by expressions that are not reduced. 
And instead of stopping on the first row that matches, all rows will be
analyzed and all rows that match will have their counts incremented. If you
don't want that behavior and would rather have no rows incremented when more
than one row matches, specify the <b>-coverCountNone</b> option to vsim or specify
"CoverCountAll = 0" in the modelsim.ini file.</li>
<li>
Code coverage condition and expression UDP tables now have improved handling
of unknown inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.0b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The user can now add unnamed dividers to the Wave window, via the command line or GUI. The following commands will add an unnamed divider:
<UL>
<LI><b>add wave -divider</b>
<LI><b>add wave -divider ""</b>
<LI><b>add wave -divider {}</b>
</UL>
Prior releases required a name and inconsistent behavior occurred when an empty string was provided as the name.</li>
<li>
The <b>toggle add</b> command now has a <b>-unique</b> option which provides
a message when a signal is attempted to be added that is an alias to a signal
already added. The alias will not be added and a message will be printed. This
makes it more clear which signals will show up in the toggle report.
Normally the alias is not added, and no message is printed.</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage now ignores zero-delay glitches.</li>
<li>
The project settings dialog now has a switch that enables or disables the automatic reloading of source files upon open.  </li>
<li>
The <b>coverage report -zeros</b> command now supplies source code 
annotation, and supports the <b>-source</b> and <b>-instance</b>
options.</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>coverage report</b> command has two new options: 
<b>-package &lt;pkgname&gt;</b> and <b>-library &lt;libname&gt;</b>. The library
option only needs to be used when you use the package option and you have packages
of the same name in different libraries. The <b>coverage report -byinst</b>
command will report packages now as well as instances. Also, packages no longer
are required to be in separate files.</li>
<li>
The coverage exclusion file format now supports an option to specify exclusion
of an instance and all instances contained within that instance. Use the
keyword "all" with the instance specific specification. See the ModelSim User's
Manual for details.</li>
<li>
A new menu entry "Compare Contents..." is added into the popup menu of the Memory window. It compares the current selected memory to a specified reference memory or reference file.</li>
<li>
The following commands were added to the popup menus in the Profile window.  <ul><li>Available in the calltree and structural panes are commands to allow selective display of only a portion of the overall results tree. The display root currently in effect, if any, is displayed at the top of the Profile window. <ul><li><b>Set Root</b> causes the display to be rooted at the currently selected item.  <li><b>Ascend Root</b> causes the display root to ascend one level.  <li><b>Reset Root</b> causes the display to be reset to normal.  </ul>

<li><b>Callers & Callees</b> - Display callers and callees for the selected function in the Profile details window.  Items above selected function are callers; items below are callees.  The selected function is distinguished with an arrow on the left and in 'hotForeground' color.

<li><b>Display in Call Tree</b> - Display the selected function in the call tree window.  Expands the call tree to display all occurrences of selected function and puts selected function into search buffer so that you can easily cycle across all occurrences of function.

<li><b>Display in Structural</b> - Same as <i>Display in Call Tree</i>, except for Structural profile window.
</ul></li>
<li>
The option <b>-truncate</b> was added to the <b>mem load</b> command. By default <b>mem load</b> produces errors for wide words similar to the behavior of $readmem[b/h]. The <b>-truncate</b> option allows wide words by ignoring the MSB bits which exceed the memory word size.

</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>coverage exclude</b> command was extended to allow direct
exclusion of code coverage objects rather than going through an exclusion
file. The syntax is: <BR>
<b>coverage exclude [-add|-remove] &lt;source&gt; [-inst &lt;path&gt;] 
[&lt;ln&gt;|(&lt;ln&gt;-&lt;ln&gt;)|all] | [(-c)|(-e) &lt;ln&gt; &lt;rn&gt;|(&lt;rn&gt;-&lt;rn&gt;)|all]</b><BR> 
For more information see the Command Reference Manual.
</li>
<li>
The options <b>-file <filename></b> and <b>-append</b> were added to the <b>assertion report</b> command to allow the user to save a report in a specified file. If the <b>-append</b> option is specified then the output file will be opened in append mode, otherwise it will be opened in write mode.</li>
