   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 6.0
       release.
          + 64-bit   ModelSim   is  supported  on  the  AMD  Opteron  and
            compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64)
            or  RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64
            platform.  The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in
            64-bit  mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also
            be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating
       your  design  libraries"  in  the  ModelSim User's Manual for more
       information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  6.0b  release.  If you are migrating to the 6.0b release from
       6.0x,  5.8x  or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x
       and  5.8x  release  notes  for  product  changes  and new features
       introduced during the 6.0x and 5.8x releases. The previous version
       release   notes  can  be  found  in  your  modeltech  installation
       directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and  greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version
            5.8b and greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32  XP  and  2000,  gcc  3.2.3  (ModelSim versions 6.0 and
            greater)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features:  the  first  is by using the -sv command line option and
       the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The  support  includes  EM64T  machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or
       RedHat  Enterprise  Linux  3  Update  3 OS and the following linux
       configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported
       on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * The  simulator  produced  a TCL error after migrating project file
       from 5.8 to 6.0.
     * Improper behavior in Modelsim 6.0 while changing Project Settings.
     * The  new  Watch  window  did  not  allow  drag and drop from other
       windows when it was undocked.
     * Ports of a System Verilog interface instantiated multiple times in
       a module were only logged for the first instance of the interface.
     * The  new Watch window had a problem with the mouse cursor grabbing
       existing items while dragging another item over the top of them.
     * A warning was not issued when ignoring nested startup commands.
     * An  uninformitive  error  message was issued when trying to load a
       coverage  database  (Tools->Code  Coverage->Load) and no design is
       loaded.
     * The  new  Watch  window moves any objects to the upper-left corner
       when dropping a new object into it.
     * Auto scroll was not implemented in the compile order window.
     * The Restart button in the Restart dialog was bound with the Return
       Key to improve ease of use.
     * The  Dataflow  window  had  problems with copy, paste and drag and
       drop operations between two Dataflow windows.
     * The following changes were made regarding Preferences:
          + The  Save Preferences option no longer exists preferences are
            saved by default when exiting.
          + The Source window preferences dialog was merged with the main
            preferences dialog.
          + PrefSource is obsolete.
          + The PrefSource(Editor) was replaced by the PrefMain(Editor).
     * A Dataflow window with an embedded Wave window failed to update on
       selection  if  the  design  unit  name  contained escaped extended
       identifiers.
     * The  Find  function  in  the  Source  window  failed to search for
       strings that started with a dash "-".
     * The  Find  function  in  the Source and Transcript windows did not
       highlight the text until you closed the find dialog.
     * A  file's status in the Project window was not updated if the file
       was  edited  externally.  If  a  file  within a project is changed
       outside  of  Modelsim,  the status icon now correctly reflects the
       change.
     * The  wordsperline option for mem save is now supported in the GUI.
       The Memory Save dialog has an entry for Line Wrap to support this.
     * The  behavior  of  the  column  separators  in the Wave window was
       changed to behave more like columns in other parts of the product.
       For  example,  dragging  the  separator between the name and value
       columns  to  the  right  will  push  the value column to the right
       rather than shrinking it.
     * PSL  is  now supported in projects. Click the "PSL File..." button
       in the Verilog or VHDL compile options dialog to add PSL files.
     * Changing the waveform colors of PSL directives was not allowed.
     * There  was a problem with the readers command in handling extended
       identifiers.
     * Drag  and  drop from Source window to Wave or List windows did not
       work.
     * ModelSim issued an error message during invocation if there was no
       printer installed.
     * The "Save" menu of Memory window was changed to "Save As...".
     * The  "Functional  Coverage"  and  "Assertion"  menus under View ->
       Debug  Windows  were  disabled in ModelSim PE since these features
       are not supported in that product.
     * The "Functional Coverage" and "Assertions" menus were removed from
       File -> New -> Windows to be consistent with the new MDI layout.
     * The  toggle coverage node count as displayed in the Objects window
       and  coverage reports did not correlate to the numbers reported in
       the Structure window.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * The  -incr  switch had no effect when the +opt option was given to
       vlog (it worked properly in 5.8).
     * $display and related system tasks were made to be re-entrant. This
       allows  $display  to  have  a  function  as  an argument where the
       function itself calls $display.
     * $fclose() system task had accepted (with unpredictable results) or
       given    very    general    error   messages   with   the   syntax
       $fclose("filename").  ModelSim  now  detects string as argument to
       $fclose() and reports it as error vsim-3562.
     * In  some  situations  a  delay  solution  was  not found for 3-way
       dependencies between negative timing checks.
     * Using  the  -g  option to specify an integer value for a parameter
       that  was  defined  as  type  real  caused  the  parameter  to  be
       incorrectly set.
     * vsim  could  corrupt  memory when a module with more than 50 ports
       was instantiated with fewer connections.
     * Multiple  packed  dimensions  were  mistakenly  allowed.  A  crash
       occurred  at run time if -fast was used. This is now flagged as an
       error at compile time.
     * In  some  cases System Verilog class method calls were incorrectly
       reporting an error that the target method could not be found.
     * A  SystemVerilog for loop variable declaration was allowed without
       initialization which is illegal. For example: for (int i; ...) was
       allowed but is illegal. for (int i = 0; ..) is the correct syntax.
     * Incorrect  output  was  produced  in  some  cases when Div and Rem
       operators  were used with a 32-bit negative divisor and the result
       was unsigned.
     * Using an indexed part select inside of a loop could give incorrect
       results when optimization was turned off (e.g. coverage enabled).
     * A  signed  value  assigned  to  a sized unsigned parameter was not
       sign-extended to the width of the parameter.
     * Calling a system task that modifies its argument with an automatic
       variable  was  corrupting  memory  if the automatic variable had a
       parameterized range.
     * Compile  and  elaboration  performance issues related to very long
       concatenations were resolved.
     * Verilog  configurations  could  not  resolve  instance arrays that
       where configured to load a configuration.
     * Illegal  upwards  defparams  that cross generate or instance array
       boundaries are now reported as errors.
     * Wildcard  use in an always block sensitivity list (i.e. always @*)
       now will handle references to hierarchies.
     * The  system  tasks $readmemh and $readmemb used to report an error
       when called with a memory that was either an automatic variable or
       a System Verilog class property.
     * $signed(w)  and  $unsigned(w)  always  returned  0  when "w" was a
       scalar net.
     * VHDL  generics  could not be set from Verilog instantiations using
       named parameters if the generics were extended identifiers.
     * In   some  cases  function  enables  with  other  function  enable
       expression  arguments  incorrectly  evaluated  the nested function
       return values.
     * Use  of  +delayed_timing_checks  with  negative timing check limit
       values caused erroneous hold violations in certain cases.
     * In  some cases delay net delay solutions for negative timing check
       limits  were  being  miscalculated  and  created  bad "No solution
       found" warnings.
     * Use       of       +delayed_timing_checks       disabled       the
       -extend_tcheck_data_limit/-extend_tcheck_ref_limit    feature   in
       certain cases.
     * Multisource  interconnect  delays  from  an inout port to an inout
       port were not handled correctly.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * PLI  routine  tf_getp()  did  not  get  the  correct value for the
       two-state SystemVerilog type int.
     * vpi_handle_by_name  did  not  handle escaped identifiers correctly
       when  the  identifier  was  a level of hierarchy in a hierarchical
       path.
     * Error  message  PLI-3691  for  system  functions used as tasks was
       changed to be a warning.
     * When  using  -v2k_int_delays,  acc_handle_simulated_net crashed or
       produced incorrect results for vector wires of unconnected ports.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * The  VHDL  compiler  crashed when defining an object of array type
       with index subtype that was a resolved (but unconstrained) subtype
       of enumeration type.
     * ModelSim  failed  to  recreate  some  VHDL  output  files  when  a
       simulation  was  started from an elaboration file or a checkpoint.
       The following conditions were necessary to cause the problem:
          + The VHDL files were openned for write but never written to.
          + A  sufficient number of files were opened, in any mode, which
            caused  Modelsim  to  try and share file handles. By default,
            the number of files is 40.
     * If   the   simulator   resolution   limit  was  specified  in  the
       modelsim.ini  file  using spaces between the integer value and the
       unit  name,  then the default value of 1ns was used instead of the
       specified   value.   For   example,  although  100ps  was  treated
       correctly, 100 ps was not.
     * An  internal error could be reported in some cases when generating
       debug  information  for certain subtypes. The internal error is of
       the   form:   "Internal  error:  ../../../src/vcom/allocate.c(928)
       regions"
     * Predefined   attribute   'VALUE   and   package  TEXTIO  procedure
       READ(REAL)  in  certain  cases  returned  inaccurate  results when
       parsing  floating  point  values with many digits. The behavior of
       these  routines  was modified to be the same as the floating point
       literal parser of vcom.
     * The  package TEXTIO procedure READ(INTEGER) erroneously considered
       a  '.'  (decimal point) to be part of the string representation of
       an  INTEGER  value,  which resulted in an error when the value was
       converted  to  INTEGER.  Now  when  a '.' is encountered it is not
       consumed in the scan.
     * Memory  corruption occurred if subelement association was used for
       a  signal  parameter  in  a function or procedure call. The memory
       corruption  potentially  resulted  in  a  crash  with  a truncated
       stacktrace and incorrect values for local variables.
     * In  some  case, VHDL signals that are arrays and have two or three
       elements  of std_logic, and are assigned to with a non-zero delay,
       leaked  memory.  If the simulation ran long enough it consumed all
       memory and crashed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * The vsim -foreign switch did not properly handle quoted pathnames.
       It   now   supports   pathnames   with  or  without  quotes;  both
       double-quotes  ("")  and  braces  ({})  may  be  used to quote the
       pathname.  Quoting  is  necessary if the path contains spaces. For
       example:
       -foreign     "initFunction    {c:/program    files/iplib/lib.dll};
       parameter"
       -foreign "initMyFLI \"/home/my design/flilibs/arch.so\"; 72"
       Note:  the  backslash  escape  characters are necessary to get the
       quote (") character past the shell.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.0b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * Initial  value  of  the  sc_signal  "sig"  inside sc_clock was not
       correct when the clock started with a negedge.
     * There was a problem with scgenmod and std_ulogic type.
     * There  was  a  problem  with  SystemC-Verilog mixed-language value
       propagation.
     * The  simulator  crashed  during  post simulation waveform activity
       with a SystemC design having long signal names.
     * SystemC  master  slave  header  files  contained assert statements
       which caused the simulator to crash.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * Use  of  2-state  Verilog variables in PSL expressions resulted in
       undeterministic behavior. When the engine was reading the variable
       value  directly  from  the  kernel  instead  of  the  quad, it was
       assuming the value to be 4-state.
     * vlog  crashed  when  attempting to compile a PSL property with the
       "forall"  operator. An error message is now displayed that informs
       the  user  that  the  "forall"  operator  is not supported in this
       release.
     * There  was  a  problem with parameter resolution checking for VHDL
       expressions passed into parameterized properties.
     * Added  a  time  unit  specifier to the start time values in logged
       messages for PSL and functional coverage records.
     * Transitions to or from states "X" and "Z" were handled incorrectly
       for PLS rose/fell functionality. Only 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0 transitions
       should be allowed.
     * Sequence  'and'  either  crashed  or produced incorrect results in
       some cases.
     * Asynchronous  builtins (onehot, onehot0, isunknown, and countones)
       gave incorrect results when used in a synchronous expression.
     * Sere  'intersect'  gave  incorrect  results  with  time-shifts  or
       zero-delay repeats.
     * Non-consc  and  next-event  sere repeats worked incorrectly at the
       end of simulation.
     * Properties  with  [*] on the right side of an implication property
       failed.
     * PSL  builtin  function  prev(sig, N) did not work correctly when N
       was  '0'.  The  expression  'prev(sig,  N)' is equivalent to 'sig'
       itself ( i.e., an expression a && prev(b, 0) <=> a && b).
     * wlfman  was  incorrectly  printing  the  PSL  directive's  type as
       "Verilog Unknown". Now it is printing "PSL ".
     * It  was  difficult to see the assertion fail indicators when there
       were  many  assertion pass indicators in a simulation session. The
       assertion  fail  indicators are now taller than the assertion pass
       indicator in the Wave window.
     * vcom  crashed  for parameterized endpoint sequences when using the
       same signal as the clock expression of the endpoint.
     * There  was  a  difference  in  count values between the functional
       coverage  browser  display  and  the  functional coverage waveform
       display in count mode.
     * Property  'never'  behaved incorrectly when it was not a top-level
       property.

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * Loading  a design after a previous load failed resulted in a crash
       for designs containing simple flip flops in multiple design units.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.0b
     * The 64-bit version of vsim for HP-UX was not built with the thread
       library enabled (like the 32-bit version).
     * ModelSim  did not produce a warning when it was unable to write to
       a VCD file. Now an assertion failure is generated.
     * The  vcover report command failed to report on instances that were
       not leaf instances.
     * 64-bit  sunos5v9  vsim  crashed while loading a design if run with
       unlimited stack size (set by the limit or ulimit shell command) on
       Solaris 8 or later.
     * An  environment  variable  was  not  expanded  when a command line
       argument   file  (specified  with  the  -f  option)  contained  an
       additional   -f  option  and  the  subsequent  path  contained  an
       environment variable.
     * On  some  versions  of  Linux  when  the  vish  process  exited it
       generated  a  message  like the following in the /var/log/messages
       file:
       Nov  3  15:32:56  alias  kernel:  application  bug: vlm(10430) has
       SIGCHLD  set  to  SIG_IGN  but  calls wait(). Nov 3 15:32:56 alias
       kernel:  (see  the  NOTES  section  of  'man  2 wait'). Workaround
       activated.
       In some kernel versions the vish process would then fail to exit.
     * Restoring  a  checkpoint  file  or  an  elaboration  file  did not
       correctly  restore  system  file handles for VHDL user files which
       had been opened more than once. Instead of sharing a single system
       file  handle,  multiple  file  handles  were  created resulting in
       strange and unpredictable output to the file.
     * If  a  relative  pathname  was  used  when  defining  the MODELSIM
       environment variable, the following error occurred:
       ** Warning: (vish-14) Failed to open "./modelsim.ini" specified by
       the MODELSIM environment variable. Using "modelsim.ini" instead"
       Relative paths are now supported.
     * During  design  elaboration,  if  one level of hierarchy failed to
       find  some  of  its  instantiated  design units (error vsim-3033),
       later  levels did not try to load their instantiated design units.
       This  suppressed  helpful  error  messages  which were produced by
       earlier versions of the simulator.
     * In  vcd2wlf,  changed  missing  upscope  declarations from a fatal
       message to a warning message.
     * A restart during code coverage caused a simulator crash in certain
       cases.

   Known Defects in 6.0b
     * examine  -expr  will  fail  if the expression contains an unlogged
       signal  because  it  is  evaluated  using the wlf file rather than
       direct communication with the ModelSim kernel.
     * Condition  coverage  and  Expression  coverage UDP tables will not
       show full coverage if the condition or expression is not logically
       reduced.
     * Toggle coverage information is only printed by the coverage report
       command when the -instance option is used. This gives a summary of
       the  signals  associated  with  the  instance.  To get an itemized
       listing of the signals, the -lines option is also required. Toggle
       information  is  not printed on file-based reports because signals
       are associated with instances, not with files.
     * Synopsys  SmartModels  can crash on the hppa64 platform. This is a
       SmartModel issue that is being addressed by Synopsys.
     * Delayed  virtual  signals, that specify the delay using pound-sign
       notation  within  the  expression,  will  not  work  correctly for
       triggering the list window. Instead, use the virtual signal -delay
       option for specifying the delay. That seems to work correctly.
     * If  you  do  a  search  in the Wave window on a bit of a multi-bit
       Verilog  register,  and  you are counting falling transitions, the
       count may be incorrect. (Transitions are counted by setting up the
       search  for  an  excessive  number of transitions, then the search
       reports the number actually found when the end of file is hit.)
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.0b
     * Toggle  coverage  has been changed to no longer record transitions
       from  U  and transitions to and from X. This allows transitions to
       and from Z to be unambiguous, instead of mixed with X transitions,
       which may not be physical.
     * The  coverage  report  command has been changed to make the branch
       computations more compatible with industry expectations.
     * Save  Format  and Save Wave Edit commands for the Wave Window have
       been  merged  together under Save. The option is presented to save
       one or the other or both in the same file.
     * Changes  have  been  made  in  the creation and processing of code
       coverage  UDP  truth tables for condition and expression coverage.
       Optimizations   have   been  added  that  reduce  redundant  rows,
       sometimes  caused by expressions that are not reduced. And instead
       of  stopping  on  the  first  row  that  matches, all rows will be
       analyzed   and   all  rows  that  match  will  have  their  counts
       incremented. If you don't want that behavior and would rather have
       no  rows  incremented  when more than one row matches, specify the
       -coverCountNone  option  to vsim or specify "CoverCountAll = 0" in
       the modelsim.ini file.
     * Code  coverage  condition  and  expression  UDP  tables  now  have
       improved handling of unknown inputs.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.0b
     * The  user can now add unnamed dividers to the Wave window, via the
       command  line  or  GUI. The following commands will add an unnamed
       divider:
          + add wave -divider
          + add wave -divider ""
          + add wave -divider {}
       Prior  releases required a name and inconsistent behavior occurred
       when an empty string was provided as the name.
     * The  toggle  add command now has a -unique option which provides a
       message when a signal is attempted to be added that is an alias to
       a  signal already added. The alias will not be added and a message
       will  be printed. This makes it more clear which signals will show
       up  in  the toggle report. Normally the alias is not added, and no
       message is printed.
     * Toggle coverage now ignores zero-delay glitches.
     * The  project  settings  dialog  now  has  a switch that enables or
       disables the automatic reloading of source files upon open.
     * The  coverage  report  -zeros  command  now  supplies  source code
       annotation, and supports the -source and -instance options.
     * The  vsim  coverage  report  command has two new options: -package
       <pkgname> and -library <libname>. The library option only needs to
       be  used  when you use the package option and you have packages of
       the  same name in different libraries. The coverage report -byinst
       command  will  report  packages  now  as  well as instances. Also,
       packages no longer are required to be in separate files.
     * The  coverage  exclusion  file  format  now  supports an option to
       specify  exclusion  of  an  instance  and  all instances contained
       within  that  instance.  Use  the  keyword "all" with the instance
       specific   specification.  See  the  ModelSim  User's  Manual  for
       details.
     * A  new  menu  entry  "Compare Contents..." is added into the popup
       menu of the Memory window. It compares the current selected memory
       to a specified reference memory or reference file.
     * The  following  commands  were  added  to  the  popup menus in the
       Profile window.
          + Available  in  the calltree and structural panes are commands
            to  allow  selective display of only a portion of the overall
            results  tree.  The display root currently in effect, if any,
            is displayed at the top of the Profile window.
               o Set  Root  causes  the  display  to  be  rooted  at  the
                 currently selected item.
               o Ascend Root causes the display root to ascend one level.
               o Reset Root causes the display to be reset to normal.
          + Callers  &  Callees  -  Display  callers  and callees for the
            selected  function in the Profile details window. Items above
            selected  function  are callers; items below are callees. The
            selected  function is distinguished with an arrow on the left
            and in 'hotForeground' color.
          + Display  in  Call Tree - Display the selected function in the
            call  tree  window.  Expands  the  call  tree  to display all
            occurrences  of  selected function and puts selected function
            into  search  buffer  so that you can easily cycle across all
            occurrences of function.
          + Display  in Structural - Same as Display in Call Tree, except
            for Structural profile window.
     * The option -truncate was added to the mem load command. By default
       mem load produces errors for wide words similar to the behavior of
       $readmem[b/h].  The -truncate option allows wide words by ignoring
       the MSB bits which exceed the memory word size.
     * The  vsim  coverage  exclude  command was extended to allow direct
       exclusion  of  code  coverage objects rather than going through an
       exclusion file. The syntax is:
       coverage    exclude   [-add|-remove]   <source>   [-inst   <path>]
       [<ln>|(<ln>-<ln>)|all] | [(-c)|(-e) <ln> <rn>|(<rn>-<rn>)|all]
       For more information see the Command Reference Manual.
     * The  options  -file and -append were added to the assertion report
       command to allow the user to save a report in a specified file. If
       the  -append  option  is  specified  then  the output file will be
       opened in append mode, otherwise it will be opened in write mode.
