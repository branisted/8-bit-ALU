   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1g
     * Waveform printing now handles labels too large to fit into the waveform
       by replacing characters in the label with '...' or removing the label
       instead of scaling down the font for the label.
     * The  waveform printing interface now handles sizes specified in cm
       correctly.
     * A WLF writer bug caused optimizations to inadvertently be disabled, in
       some cases, if a large number of signals (>50,000) was logged after time
       0. This resulted in slower than expected Wave window drawing speed and
       potentially a vsim assertion.
     * A WLF dataset snapshot bug caused the snapshotting to become disabled
       under some circumstances.
     * A bug in the "dataset close" function in certain cases caused a crash if
       a virtual signal was currently displayed in the Objects window and the
       command dataset close -all was issued.
     * The Wave window crashed in certain cases if the window was closed while
       waves were actively drawing.
     * There  were problems with the GUI "Customize" feature, such as the
       buttons were not added, errors were produced, or the U/I locked up. This
       feature is found under the Windows menu, or when using the commands
       apply_button_adder or _add_menu.
     * A memory leak caused the U/I to run out of resources and either hang or
       crash the simulator after multiple simulation runs during a single
       session.
     * Dragging a signal from the Source window to the Wave window took a very
       long time.
     * Selection of a non-active process in the Structure or Dataflow window in
       certain cases required excessive time as the Active Process window was
       populated. An example of this scenario is immediately after elaboration
       but before any run has been done when many Verilog "initial" processes
       would be scheduled. This time has been minimized.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1g
     * An optimization of a "repeat (1)" statement under the default label of a
       case statement resulted in an internal error during compilation.
     * An  inversion  of  an or-reduction expression (and other reduction
       operators) evaluated to incorrect results in some cases.
     * In  certain cases the command coverage report -du did not have the
       correct data for Verilog registers.
     * vlog -source crashed in certain cases when attempting to print a source
       line with a warning or error message.
     * In  the  vlog  compiler, a cache related to timing check condition
       expressions  was  not cleared correctly resulting in unpredictable
       behaviour in some cases.
     * Under  certain conditions, the gate-level optimized cell evaluator
       ignored notifier register toggles fanning into always blocks.
     * When +multisource_int_delays and/or +transport_int_delays was specified
       with -v2k_int_delays or compiled SDF files, in simulating a design that
       had nets with large fanin and fanout, the SDF load times were very long.
     * When +grp_ntc_outputs was specified for vlog and +multisource_int_delays
       or +transport_int_delays was specified for vsim, some simulations looped
       infinitely.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1g
     * When compiled with -O1, individual association in a configuration's port
       maps incorrectly connected signals if the component port was an array
       and has different bounds than the actual associated with it.
     * If an alias to a type was declared in the same scope as the type was
       declared,  the  implicit  operators  for the type were incorrectly
       redeclared. This was a problem if the implicit operators were replaced
       with explicit versions. This caused the compiler to report ambiguous
       expressions.
     * An  expression with a subexpression of an array type followed by a
       subexpression  involving a short-circuit operation with array type
       operands in some cases resulted in the preceding subexpression having
       its value corrupted.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1g
     * Changes did not propagate on a forced or released Verilog I/O port that
       was connected to a VHDL I/O port.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1g
     * vcover with the merge argument crashed in certain cases.
     * The coverage save command produced duplicate information in the coverage
       save output file under some conditions.
     * The command vcd dumpports crashed for VHDL 'bit' type (this type is not
       supported - see the documentation for more information).
     * There was a problem with the coverage report and coverage save commands
       where design hierarchy regions were ignored if they had toggles coverage
       enabled and no other coverage metrics enabled.
     * There was a problem in vcover with the report option where condition and
       expression tables were missing from certain coverage reports.
     * Condition and expression data was missing from certain GUI coverage
       windows.
     * If vsim assertions were redirected to a file other than the transcript
       file (with the -assertfile command line option or the "AssertFile"
       modelsim.ini variable) and the assertion file grew to a size greater
       than 2GB, vsim crashed.
     * vcover with the options report -xml produced the wrong condition and
       expression statistics which was caused by the active count not including
       exclusions.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.1g
     * dts0100335166 - Modelsim crashing when using "vcd dumpports".
     * dts0100341584 - Verilog compilation is not able to handle >1000 modules
       in one vlog command.
     * dts0100335726 - Documentation not clear enough about coverage exclude
       -inst.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.1g
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * The add_menu command does not work for the Wave window. The work around
       is to use the [winfo toplevel $wave] command to obtain the correct
       widget pathname; for example:
       set wave [view -undock wave]
       set wavetop [winfo toplevel $wave]
       add_menu $wavetop "MyMenu"
       This work around is not required for future versions, but should not
       cause problems.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.1g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1g
     * HDL source code pragmas have been added for individual code coverage
       metrics.  This  allows  you  to turn statement, branch, condition,
       expression and fsm coverage on and off independently using source code
       pragmas. To use it, add an additional argument to the coverage on or
       coverage off pragma using characters to indicate the coverage metric.
       This works for both VHDL and Verilog. (For toggle coverage, use the
       "coverage toggle_ignore" pragma.) For example:
       // coverage off sce
       turns off statement, condition and expression coverage, and leaves the
       other metrics alone.
       // coverage on bf
       turns on branch and fsm coverage, leaving the other metrics alone.
     * Added  a -depth option to the coverage save -instance command that
       specifies the depth of hierarchy to save. The following example will
       save two levels of hierarchy, starting at /top/myinst.
       coverage save -inst /top/myinst -depth 2 myout.cov
     * Added a -filter option to the coverage save -instance command that will
       filter out excluded instances and everything below.
     * A feature has been added to coverage report to print the file name for
       the design unit in the toggle details section. To turn it on, you need
       to use coverage report -tfile.
     * SDF annotation support of setuphold and recrem timing checks using a
       combination of explicit condition arguments and implicit condtions on
       events were added.
