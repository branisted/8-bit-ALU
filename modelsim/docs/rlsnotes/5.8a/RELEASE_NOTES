   Key Information
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8  betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating  your  Libraries"  in  the  ModelSim  Installation &
       Licensing Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.8a  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.8a release from
       5.7x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 5.8
       release.
          + For Linux:
               o Linux  is  built  on  RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1.
                 This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher.
               o RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release
                 with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60.
               o RedHat 9.0 is now supported (32-bit only).
               o We  will  soon  validate  32-bit ModelSim on the Opteron
                 platform  (in  32-bit  mode  only).  The  first OS to be
                 supported  is  SuSE SLES 9. It is not recommended to run
                 32-bit  ModelSim  on versions of SuSE earlier than 9. At
                 the  time of writing this release note, ModelSim has not
                 been validated on SuSE 9 although this validation should
                 be completed soon.
               o Linux now supports large files.
          + For AIX:
               o rs64  is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1
                 and higher OS versions.
               o rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
               o rs64  will  support  large  files if you are using a JFS
                 type file system and the large file option is enabled.
               o AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * It  was  possible to install a virtual signal in a virtual region,
       but  it  was not possible to see the virtual signal in the Signals
       window because the virtual region could not be selected in the sim
       pane.
     * The encoding system was not initialized properly when ModelSim was
       started without a design.
     * The  GUI crashed when loading a Verilog module with a large number
       of source files.
     * When  the mem search -replace command was used to change the value
       of a VHDL signal memory, the changes in the value were not logged.
     * The  nolog  command  only  recognized  the  last  port mode on the
       command  line.  For  example,  the  command  nolog -in -out * only
       nologged the -out signals.
     * Under obscure conditions the following error message was reported:
       "INTERNAL ERROR: Illegal array element type in log_event."
     * mem load -filldata { } did not generate an error message.
     * The  input  address  range  in the Change/Load/Save dialogs of the
       Memory  window is now checked so it matches the address radix used
       in the currently viewed memory.
     * The  Memory  window  was  highlighting an incorrect amount of data
       after  "Data  Search"  when the search pattern involved an escaped
       id.
     * In  GUI mode, if vsim was started with options that are valid only
       when  loading  a  design  but  no  design  was  specified, the GUI
       appeared  to  hang. The footer message Loading... would be present
       and  updating.  In  fact,  there  was  a ModelSim> prompt that was
       completely  usable  along  with the menus. ModelSim was changed so
       that  on  a  load  error  when  no design is specified the loading
       message is turned off.
     * The  command  report simulator was inadvertently changed to report
       simulation. It has been changed back.
     * A  problem  viewing  HTML Help documents existed when ModelSim was
       installed  on  a  remote location requiring UNC pathname access to
       the help documents.
     * In  some  cases  certain  radix  settings  caused  analog waves to
       display incorrectly.
     * The  SIGPIPE  signal  on  UNIX  systems caused the vish process to
       exit. This happened if the user wrote to a user-created TCL socket
       where  the  process  owning  the  other  end  of  the  socket  was
       terminated. The vish signal handler no longer catches SIGPIPE.
     * mem  load  with  an ASCII compressed file and the -filldata option
       did not work properly.
     * The  5.8  GUI supports the ability to "drag-out" window panes from
       the Main window. If 5.7x was invoked and used after this operation
       was performed in 5.8, a crash resulted.
     * The  column widths of the coverage report output were increased to
       prevent  large  counts  from  being merged together and making the
       report difficult to read.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * In  some  cases  a  design  compiled with -fast produced incorrect
       results from continuous assignments having unequal widths or signs
       between the left-hand side and right-hand side.
     * Previously,  in  indexed  part  selects,  whitespace was permitted
       between characters (eg, "+ :", "- :"). This syntax now generates a
       warning.
     * Expressions  of  the  form  ~(x  &  y)  and ~(x | y) in some cases
       generated incorrect machine code due to improper optimizations.
     * The  assignment  of  a  floating  point  value  to  a register was
       truncated  to  a  64-bit  integer  even  if the register was large
       enough to hold the converted value.
     * Hierarchical  references  to  memory  elements in external modules
       resulted in excessive memory allocation (equivalent to the size of
       the entire memory for each reference).
     * In  some  cases  a  large  number  of nested generate conditionals
       resulted in a compiler hang.
     * A  design  compiled  with  -fast  produced  incorrect  results  if
       different  instances of the same module had the same parameter set
       to the same value, but the sign of the value differed, and if sign
       extension on that parameter affected expression results.
     * Verilog  named  blocks with no variable declarations in some cases
       crashed  the simulator if they were contained within another named
       block that was disabled and the model was compiled with -fast.
     * Expressions  of  the  form  (~p  &  c)  and (~p | c) in some cases
       resulted  in a compiler crash if "p" was a parameter and "c" was a
       constant expression.
     * Large  modules containing many hierarchical references resulted in
       slow compiler performance.
     * A  port  consisting  of  a  concatenation  having mixed port modes
       incorrectly resulted in a compiler error message.
     * Exiting  a  simulation with $finish in Windows 2000 could leave an
       orphaned vsimk.exe process.
     * In  some  cases a design compiled with -fast resulted in incorrect
       parameter  values,  particularly  in  cases with parameters having
       string values.
     * Simulation   errors   could   occur   during   SDF  annotation  of
       interconnect  delay  to  a  module  port  when the module port was
       hierarchically   right   above  an  optimized  cell  port  with  a
       $setuphold or $recrem timing check.
     * Simulations  using  SmartModels  on  64-bit platforms were getting
       invalid time values when the time exceeded 2147483647 time units.
     * Generate-conditional  branching  was  not  performed properly when
       tasks  and  functions  were defined inside a generate-conditional.
       This  could  result  in  the unexpected execution of a conditional
       branch.
     * Instances and nets within `protect...`endprotect regions could not
       be    SDF-annotated.    It    is   now   possible   to   use   the
       -sdfmin/-sdftyp/-sdfmax  vsim  options to annotate protected code.
       However,  the  $sdf_annotate()  system task is still not supported
       with `protect.
     * `delay_mode_unit did not work correctly with zero-delay UDPs.
     * In  some cases the $random system task caused a crash if used as a
       statement.
     * In   some   cases  an  out-of-bounds  memory  select  produced  an
       incorrectly  sized  'X'  result  where  the  result was lengthened
       because  of  context.  The 'X' result should always be the size of
       the memory element.
     * In some cases an always block having a part-select of a vector net
       in  the  sensitivity  list  resulted in an internal compiler error
       where   the   bounds   of   the  part-select  contained  parameter
       expressions.
     * Under rare conditions vlog would not write a module to the library
       even though it generated a message indicating it was compiled.
     * Verilog  designs  with hazard detection enabled could crash if run
       multiple  times  within the same ModelSim session (e.g., simulate,
       quit -sim, reload design, simulate....).
     * A compiler warning is now issued if an out-of-bounds bit select is
       detected.  The  warning  may  be  suppressed  with the +nowarnBSOB
       compiler  switch. Previously, this check was only performed if the
       -lint switch was on.
     * Compiling  a  design  with  -fast resulted in an internal compiler
       error if the design contained a conditional specify path where the
       condition  was  constant after the optimizer propagated a constant
       through a continuous assignment.
     * A  design  compiled  with  -fast  in some cases produced incorrect
       results  if  a  vector  net  was connected to a port of an inlined
       module where the port type was the dominant net type (a wand type,
       for example).
     * In   some   situations  a  non-blocking  assignment  to  a  32-bit
       concatenation  of  single-bit  values  caused  the  top  bit to be
       assigned a value that could not be changed by later assignments.
     * A design compiled with -fast resulted in a compiler crash or false
       error  if  a  1-bit  wide vector register was connected to a 1-bit
       wide  vector  port  of an inlined instance and if the instantiated
       module contained a part-select of that port.
     * The   -fast   optimization   that   propagates  constants  through
       continuous  assignments  produced incorrect behavior in some cases
       if   a   constant   was  propagated  through  multiple  continuous
       assignments involving varying width vector nets.
     * Signals  window  port  values  for optimized Verilog cells (-fast)
       were being displayed as "Bad Data" in some cases.
     * In  a  design  with multisource interconnects, if only a subset of
       the  interconnects  was  annotated,  a  driver  could be connected
       incorrectly.
     * Various  errors  and  crashes occurred when a task or function was
       defined within a generate conditional block.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * Sometimes  vpi_iterate(vpiPorts,  netbit_handle)  gave an internal
       error  claiming  that iterating on ports was not supported for net
       bits.
     * vpi_handle(vpiSimNet, net_handle) has been implemented.
     * An   unsupported   data  type  or  error  condition  occurring  in
       acc_handle_tfarg()  now returns a NULL handle. Previously it could
       result in a crash.
     * The  vpi_put_value()  function  now supports returning a handle of
       type  vpiSchedEvent and this handle can be passed in as the obj to
       vpi_put_value() with the flags set to vpiCancelEvent to cancel the
       scheduled  event.  The  vpiSchedEvent handle will work as expected
       with the functions vpi_get() and vpi_free_object().
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * The  simulator crashed in some cases if an entity/component's port
       was  an  unconstrained array of records and subelement association
       was used in the port map.
     * VITAL models that used the function VitalExtendToFillDelay did not
       correctly  generate  elab files. When the elab file was loaded and
       run the simulation reported an error:
       # ** Error: VitalExtendToFillDelay(delay'length /= [1,2,3,6])
       # Time: 0 ns Iteration: 0 Instance: /INSTANCE
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3482) Negative delay in signal assignment.
     * In some cases, ModelSim SE crashed after forcing a signal that was
       driven by a clocked process.
     * VHDL  would  generate  incorrect  error messages about extra ports
       being  present  in  a port map if an error occurred when trying to
       load a design unit that did not exist.
       #  **  Error:  (vsim-3732) src/test69.vhd(226): No default binding
       for component at /c1.
       # (Port 'outb' is not on the entity.)
       # Region: /top_test69/c1
     * VHDL  condition code coverage did not work for VHDL variables, for
       integer  relational  subexpressions,  or  for std_logic comparison
       with 'L' or 'H'.
     * If  a  package  containing  a  constant  is  defined  using nested
       concatenations,  and  the  package  is compiled at an optimization
       level (e.g., -O0) different from other design units that reference
       the   package,  references  to  objects  in  the  package  may  be
       incorrect.  In  some cases this caused crashes or incorrect values
       to  be  computed. Changes were made to the compiler to ensure that
       the  sequence of values and type descriptors exported by a package
       are  consistent  with  the expected sequence, even under different
       optimization levels.
       NOTE:  This  change  renders  libraries  created under version 5.8
       incompatible  with  version 5.8a if the libraries contain packages
       compiled  under  different  optimization  levels. Therefore, these
       libraries must be refreshed. This issue effects ModelSim SE only.
     * A  warning  message  in some cases was incorrectly produced by the
       compiler in which generate statements contained declarative items.
       The  message  warned  about  a missing BEGIN keyword even when the
       BEGIN was present. The generated code is correct and it is safe to
       ignore the warning.
     * Warning/error messages are now issued when generate statements use
       non-static values as conditions or ranges.
     * If  variables  in a process or procedure/function were inferred to
       be  constants,  and the declarations were out of order relative to
       their  assignment  statements, it was possible that initial values
       of  variables  with  earlier  declarations  did  not reflect their
       assigned   values.   This  problem  was  addressed  by  reordering
       declarations  within  the  compiler  to  conform  to  the order of
       assignments.
     * After forces were applied to a VHDL signal, if an examine was done
       before  a  run command then a crash could occur during the examine
       command.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * mti_FindRegion() erroneously returned NULL if the leaf name of the
       input  pathname  contained  uppercase  character(s) and the object
       being  sought was the instance name of a Verilog instance that was
       a basic identifier.
     * Calling mti_GetProductVersion() from within a quit callback caused
       ModelSim  to  exit  with  an  error  status  indicating  a license
       problem.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.8a
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * After  an  elaboration  error such as a port mismatch, SystemC did
       not  unload  the shared library correctly. When re-elaborating the
       design,  the incorrect message "Error: Time Resolution already set
       ..."  was  displayed.  The problem existed on all platforms except
       Solaris  5.6  and  7.  For those two platforms, the user may issue
       quit  -sim  prior  to  reloading  the  design. This command forces
       ModelSim to unload shared objects, including the SystemC library.
     * There was a problem using typedef names in template arguments.
     * User   SystemC  constructors  did  not  successfully  load  shared
       objects.  Furthermore,  such shared objects can successfully refer
       to symbols in the user's SystemC source files.
     * In  the  modelsim.ini  file, the variable PathSeparator allows the
       user  to  change  the  path  separator.  SystemC  failed  when the
       PathSeparator was not set to '/'.
     * Designs   containing   SystemC  modules  crashed  during  exit  if
       elaborated in the cosim shadow network mode.

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8a
     * The  size  of WLF files created by the wlfman filter operation has
       been reduced. Also, the default order of the resultant signals has
       been corrected to match the order in the input WLF file.
     * A  wlfman  filter  bug  prevented  Verilog named events from being
       written to the output WLF file.
     * scgenmod did not handle ports of type std_logic_vector correctly.
     * VCD escaped identifiers were not handled correctly.
     * When using -f to specify a file containing additional command line
       arguments,  in  some  cases  the  simulator produced the following
       message:
       execv: Arg list too long
     * The  use  of  -cover  t  or -cover x sometimes resulted in a crash
       during elaboration.
     * The  where command would incorrectly give the following error when
       used without a loaded design:
       **  Error:  (vish-4000)  A  design must be loaded before the where
       command can be used.
     * vcd2wlf  had  a problem related to single bit busses with non-zero
       left  and  right  elements  of  the form "foo[12:12]" connected to
       (i.e., sharing the same VCD identifier with) a scalar signal.
     * When loading an elab file, the default radix from the modelsim.ini
       file was not restored.
     * wlfman  had a problem which could result in scopes being generated
       in  a  different order than in the original wlf file. This problem
       occurred only on sunos5v9, rs6000, rs64, and win32 platforms.
     * If  a  soft link was used for the modelsim.ini file, any update of
       the .ini file by a ModelSim tool (e.g., vmap) resulted in the link
       being replaced by a local file.
       The  same  issue  exists with hard links. The hard link issue will
       not be fixed.
     * A  license  failure problem existed in LE when doing a reload of a
       design while running with a nodelocked license.
     * The  toggle add command has been changed for SE only so that it no
       longer requires a coverage license. This change returns the toggle
       add  command  to  its  former  behavior  prior  to 5.8. A coverage
       license  is  still  required for PE or LE and for extended (-full)
       toggle coverage.

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.8a
     * DR 00156540 - Should give error on incorrect part-select syntax.
     * DR  00158785  - cosim issue with do file and missing -do argument.
       The  simulator  will hang if there is any problem while attempting
       to elaborate the design in this mode.
     * DR 00157556 - Adding a force in a design with certain VHDL process
       optimizations could result in a crash.
     * DR 00159272 - MTI Simulator reports incorrect simulation time from
       VMC SWIFT Model.
     * DR  00161341  -  Modelsim  solaris 64-bit crashes on instantiation
       with 64-ports.
     * DR  00148685  -  Wrong  VHDL  generation due to vectors in verilog
       module declaration.
     * DR 00159570 - "-h" option to vsim shows a big part of TCL code.
     * DR  00148932  -  X-values  do not get propagated correctly through
       design when using the XOR operator.
     * DR  00157918  -  Finding  objects of type vpiPorts from objects of
       type vpiNetBit not been implemented.
     * DR  00161950 - modelsim.ini library information not being reloaded
       into .mpf file on closing and reopening a project.
     * DR 0000162798 - Analog format not available with ModelSim 5.8.
     * DR 00152231 - Request for error messages 3365 and 3061 that report
       port number to report the port name as well.
     * DR 00149344 - Support for field width formatting in common Verilog
       escape sequences.
     * ER  00153227  -  Request  for vpi_put_value() to return a an event
       handle  and  also  for  support  of  vpiNamedEvent  or canceling a
       scheduled event.
       This  enhancement  has  been implemented with the exception of the
       vpiNamedEvent portion.
     * ER   00141777  -  SDF  annotation  isn't  currently  supported  to
       `protected portions of the design.
       This  enhancement request was implemented via command line options
       -sdfmin,  -sdftyp  and  -sdfmax  for  protected code. However, the
       $sdf_annotate() system task is still not supported with `protect.

   Product Changes to 5.8a
     * profile  option  collapse_sections  does  not need to be specified
       before  the  first  run command after profile on. Prior to the new
       behavior,  the  collapse_sections option filtered the profile data
       as it was collected. Now, this option affects only the contents of
       the  data  reported  by  the  next profile report command. profile
       option  collapse_sections  and profile option raw_data continue to
       toggle  the  current  setting.  Now  it  is  possible to set these
       options on or off, or query their current values:
       profile option collapse_sections|raw_data [on|off|status]
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8a
     * The  ModelSim  Wave window Combine Selected Signals dialog box now
       supports reversing the bits of signals being concatenated. This is
       also supported now by the virtual signal command. For details, see
       the ModelSim User manuals.
     * New features were added to the verror command:
Usage: verror [-fmt|-tag|-full] <msgNum> ...
       verror [-fmt|-tag|-full] [-kind <facility>] -all
       verror -ranges
       The  -fmt option prints out the format string which is used in the
       actual error message.
       The -tag option prints the error message tag used internally.
       The  -full  option  prints  the tag, format, and help text for the
       messages.
       The  -all option dumps all the error messages, or, using the -kind
       option,  the dump can be limited to a particular facility. This is
       useful for "grep"ing for a particular error message.
       The  -ranges  option  dumps  the  numeric  ranges of error message
       numbers by facility.
     * The  WLFOptimize directive has been added to the modelsim.ini file
       to  turn WLF optimization on or off. WLF optimization was added in
       5.8 and is on by default.
     * A  -all  option  has  been added to the vdir command. It lists the
       contents  of  all  libraries  listed  in the library mapping file.
       Below is the new command syntax:
       vdir [-l] [-r] { [-all] | [-lib <path>] [<primary>] }
     * The   vsim   coverage   and   -cover   options  can  now  be  used
       interchangeably.
     * VHDL  aliases can now be viewed in the Signals window and added to
       the List and Wave windows.
     * A  new  Wave window preference (On Close Warn for Save Format) was
       added.  If  this  option  is  set  in  the Wave Window Preferences
       dialog,  the  user is prompted to save the format if an attempt is
       made to close the Wave window.
     * A  new  option  "Automatic  Add to Wave" was added to the Dataflow
       Options  dialog to enable/disable ChaseX/TraceX automatic addition
       to the Wave window.
     * An  option  has  been  added to the Source window Examine to allow
       examination  of values at the current active cursor time. New menu
       items have been added to the Source window menu Tools > Options:
       Examine Now
       Examine Current Cursor
     * Two  new  subcommands  for toggle coverage have been added. toggle
       disable  will  disable  the gathering and reporting of toggle data
       for the specified signals. toggle enable will re-instate gathering
       and  reporting  of  toggle  data  on  signals that were previously
       disabled.  The  coverage  save command will ignore disabled toggle
       signals. The usage is:
       toggle [disable | enable] [-all] [-in] [-inout] [-internal] [-out]
       [-ports] [-r] <node_name>
       where <node_name> may be a wildcard expression.
     * vsim messages 3017, 3061, and 3365 have been enhanced to print out
       the  port names. The following messages have been added to improve
       the above messages: 3722, 3060, and 3389.
     * A new option, "profile", has been added to the wlfman utility.
       wlfman profile [-rank] [-top <number>] <wlffile>
       This  option provides information about the approximate space used
       in  the  wlf  file  for  each signal logged. The -rank switch will
       order  this  information  by  most  to  least space used. The -top
       <number> option will limit the signals listed to only the <number>
       that use the most space.
     * ModelSim  5.8a  now  supports an assertion-based verification flow
       with  the release of its PSL implementation for the VHDL language.
       Vcom  will accept PSL statements either as embedded pragmas within
       VHDL  source  code,  or  from  an  external  file containing vunit
       declarations.   Along   with   assertion   text  messaging  during
       simulation,  a  gui-based  browser  allows for easy inspection and
       control  of  the  assertions  instances.  Additionally,  assertion
       behavior  can  be  monitored over time in the waveform viewer. For
       further  details  about supported constructs and tool usage please
       consult the ModelSim User Guide.
     * In  5.8a  the  behavior  of  the  toggle  add  command has changed
       slightly. It now returns the following:
          + If  no  signals are added and no signals are found to already
            be  in  the  toggle  set,  "Nothing added." is returned. (The
            reliability of this message has been improved.)
          + If no signals are added and some signals are found to already
            be in the toggle set, "0" is returned.
          + If  some  signals  are added, the count of the number of bits
            added  is returned. Signals found to already be in the toggle
            set are ignored.
     * Added -fast support for Verilog 2001 configurations.
