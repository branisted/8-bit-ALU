<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform will be discontinued as of the ModelSim 5.8 release:<br>
<UL>
<LI>AIX 4.2
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.7 
Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries" 
in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models. 
</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 5.7g 
release. If you are migrating to the 5.7g release from 5.6x or earlier releases,
please also consult version 5.7x release notes for product changes and new 
features introduced during the 5.7 patch releases. The previous version 
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at 
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
In the next major release, the linux platform executables will be built on 
RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1. This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 
and higher. RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release with a new
platform vco.</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 6.0 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7g</b>
<ul>
<li>
Setting the RunLength TCL variable from the command prompt did not correctly
set RunLength.  (e.g.  set RunLength 100ns )  Setting the run length
from the simulation dialog box or from the run length entry box on
the Main window worked correctly.</li>
<li>
VHDL alias objects (variables and signals) could not be dragged from the Variables window into the Wave or List windows. Attempts to add object aliases to the Wave and List windows via Tcl commands would also fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7g</b>
<ul>
<li>
Multisource interconnects from io ports to input ports would not correctly select the interconnect delay.</li>
<li>
When the xor (^) or xnor (^~) bitwise operators were used with multi-bit operands within expressions composed of logical operators (&&, ||, !), X-values in higher- order bit positions could be erroneously discarded. This problem began to appear in version 5.7c.</li>
<li>
Compiling <b>-fast</b> with <b>+acc=p</b> in some cases crashed the simulator when some module inputs were unconnected.</li>
<li>
SDF annotation to conditional SETUPHOLD statements in optimized Verilog cells failed (sometimes silently).</li>
<li>
Argument checking for externally referenced task enable statements could crash ModelSim when loading a design which contained conditional generate statements.
This problem was reported as SR #213201401.</li>
<li>
A memory leak occured with some negative timing checks of optimized Verilog cells.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7g</b>
<ul>
<li>
When restoring an elaboration checkpoint file, user file names would not be remapped with the <b>-filemap_elab</b> switch if the modelsim.ini file had the DelayFileOpen variable set to 1.</li>
<li>
The `path_name attribute returned an incorrect value in optimized
designs if the following conditions occurred:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The `path_name occurred within a clocked process.
<LI>There were clocked processes with the same clock and reset in different
   instances.
<LI>The design was compiled with <b>-04</b> or <b>-05</b>.
</UL></li>
<li>
When subscripting an array whose bounds are locally static, if a subscript is
an alias whose target is a locally static constant, incorrect subscripting code
could be generated. As a result, the subscript was incorrectly evaluated
as being zero.</li>
<li>
If you have a clocked process and you are doing code coverage, you
need to be aware that optimizations to the clocked process will
eliminate some statements and make the code coverage appear to
have no hits where you would expect hits to be. To remedy this
situation, recompile with the <b>-O0</b> option to turn off the optimization.</li>
