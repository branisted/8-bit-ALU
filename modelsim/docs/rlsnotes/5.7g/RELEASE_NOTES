   Key Information
     * The following platform will be discontinued as of the ModelSim 5.8
       release:
          + AIX 4.2
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.7  Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.7g  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.7g release from
       5.6x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * In  the next major release, the linux platform executables will be
       built  on  RedHat  Enterprise  Workstation  2.1.  This  version is
       compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher. RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will
       be supported for one release with a new platform vco.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 6.0 and higher.

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7g
     * Setting the RunLength TCL variable from the command prompt did not
       correctly  set  RunLength. (e.g. set RunLength 100ns ) Setting the
       run  length  from the simulation dialog box or from the run length
       entry box on the Main window worked correctly.
     * VHDL  alias  objects  (variables and signals) could not be dragged
       from  the Variables window into the Wave or List windows. Attempts
       to  add  object  aliases  to  the  Wave  and  List windows via Tcl
       commands would also fail.

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7g
     * Multisource  interconnects  from io ports to input ports would not
       correctly select the interconnect delay.
     * When  the  xor  (^)  or xnor (^~) bitwise operators were used with
       multi-bit   operands   within   expressions  composed  of  logical
       operators  (&&,  ||,  !),  X-values in higher- order bit positions
       could  be  erroneously  discarded. This problem began to appear in
       version 5.7c.
     * Compiling  -fast  with  +acc=p in some cases crashed the simulator
       when some module inputs were unconnected.
     * SDF  annotation  to  conditional SETUPHOLD statements in optimized
       Verilog cells failed (sometimes silently).
     * Argument checking for externally referenced task enable statements
       could  crash  ModelSim  when  loading  a  design  which  contained
       conditional  generate  statements. This problem was reported as SR
       #213201401.
     * A  memory  leak  occured  with  some  negative  timing  checks  of
       optimized Verilog cells.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7g
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7g
     * When  restoring  an  elaboration  checkpoint file, user file names
       would  not  be  remapped  with  the  -filemap_elab  switch  if the
       modelsim.ini file had the DelayFileOpen variable set to 1.
     * The  `path_name attribute returned an incorrect value in optimized
       designs if the following conditions occurred:
          + The `path_name occurred within a clocked process.
          + There were clocked processes with the same clock and reset in
            different instances.
          + The design was compiled with -04 or -05.
     * When  subscripting  an array whose bounds are locally static, if a
       subscript  is  an alias whose target is a locally static constant,
       incorrect  subscripting  code could be generated. As a result, the
       subscript was incorrectly evaluated as being zero.
     * If you have a clocked process and you are doing code coverage, you
       need  to  be  aware that optimizations to the clocked process will
       eliminate  some  statements  and  make the code coverage appear to
       have  no  hits  where  you would expect hits to be. To remedy this
       situation,   recompile  with  the  -O0  option  to  turn  off  the
       optimization.

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7g

   General Defects Repaired in 5.7g
     * When  using  the  coverage  report  -source  filename  command, if
       filename  contained  a  path  other  than  a simple file name, the
       command would fail with the message "File not found".
     * During  SDF  backannotations ModelSim can now handle long instance
       names up to 1024 characters.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7g
     * DR 00151616 - Crash involving Verilog2001 generate.
     * DR 00150059 - ModelSim bug in 2001 constructs implementation.
     * DR  00150108  -  ModelSim  Crash  when  trying  to call FLI within
       generate statement in Verilog.
     * DR 00147993 - ModelSim does not flag error in UDP file.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 5.7g
     * When  doing code coverage on packages, each package needs to be in
       a  separate  file and not be mixed with entities or architectures,
       or the statistics will be merged together.
