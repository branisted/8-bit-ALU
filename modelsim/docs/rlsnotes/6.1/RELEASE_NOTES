   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     *
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to
       version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that
       the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 8.2. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server
       and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this
       release. If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and Solaris 7, gcc 3.2
          + Solaris 8 and 9, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328. CRITICAL
       LICENSING INFORMATION: For this beta release of the product, the FLEXlm
       licensing software being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it
       will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the
       license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater
       than  9.5. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this
       release will be FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of
       your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary
       to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and
       lmgrd contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you
       don't need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * The following Windows platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2
       release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * Memory tab in Workspace window is invoked by default now. User does not
       need to explicitly invoke the menu item View -> Debug Windows -> Memory.
     * mem compare CLI is now provided from GUI mode. The syntax is mem compare
       <-mem ref_mem | -file ref_file> actual_mem.
     * The Memory window now uses "Import" instead of "Load" for loading the
       memory data, and "Export" instead of "Save As..." for saving the memory
       data.
     * The edit command did not work correctly on the Windows platform. It
       failed to launch the user defined editor.
     * The -wlfnoopt switch now disables the WLF viewer from considering WLF
       optimizations  when  viewing a WLF file. Up until this release the
       -wlfnoopt switch had only affected the writing of the WLF file. The WLF
       viewer has always used optimization data if present in the WLF file.
     * The readers command for a single bit of bus signal showed the readers of
       the complete bus.
     * The editor crashed during a Find and Replace operation.
     * The Create Testbench wizard (in the source templates) produced a TCL
       stacktrace while creating a VHDL use clause for the testbench.
     * ModelSim crashed if the first window encountered during invocation was
       undocked.  Typically  this  is the Workspace window, but it is not
       necessarily limited to this window.
     * On Windows only, if a file type is registered with any tool other than
       ModelSim, ModelSim did not use that tool to edit the file of that type
       and used ModelSim's source editor instead.
     * There was a problem with the WLF size limit -wlfslim and/or WLF time
       limit -wlftlim options which caused intermittent crashes depending on
       number of logged signals.
     * There was a problem with key board accelerators in the Wave window. Keys
       f, i, etc. were not modifying zoom properly when the Wave window was
       activated.
     * The dock and undock features are now supported for the Memory Data Pane.
     * The compare add command failed to handle sub-elements of vectors.
     * The Wave window will now automatically scroll when an item is dragged
       near the top or bottom sides of the name column.
     * Modelsim failed to use the environment variable EDITOR if it contains
       spaces.
     * When  the  backspace key was used in the source editor, it behaved
       differently depending on if the editor was docked or undocked.
     * A problem in the WLF writer code caused VHDL variables to display the
       incorrect waveform in the Wave window when significantly zoomed out.
     * In the Wave window 'bitwise' expansion of compared busses crashed the
       simulator.
     * Creating a virtual signal crashed if the (concat_noflatten) qualifier
       was used and the virtual signal contained Verilog nets.
     * excluding an instance from the coverage misses pane caused repeated
       items to appear in the instance coverage pane. this issue has been
       fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * The compiler failed to detect an illegal UDP table entry specifying a
       non-X output for all X inputs.
     * Expressions of the form "a==b" sometimes incorrectly evaluated to 1'bx
       in optimized designs, if one of the operands was a compile-time constant
       with some x or z bits and some known bits.
     * Assignments with an LHS wider than 32 bits, and with a smaller RHS which
       evaluated to all x's, sometimes did not show x's in all bits of the LHS
       in an optimized design.
     * Error and warning reporting with -source crashed sometimes with code
       coverage messages. The crash was observed with condition coverage on
       certain designs.
     * $fread() did not trigger events when loading memories. Now an event
       control (eg. "always @(mem[0])") executes when $fread() loads "mem".
     * The  vlog  compiler hung in certain cases when compiling a task or
       function with assignment statements where the target of the assignments
       was a concatenation of hierarchical references.
     * The virtual signal command did not work with optimized Verilog cell
       ports.
     * The simulator crashed with corrupted memory if branch code coverage was
       on and a Verilog case statement had a case alternative that was not a
       constant, such as a parameter.
     * Code coverage was not working inside Verilog interface blocks.
     * vlog  crashed when attempting to access multiple dimensions for an
       undefined variable.
     * vlog produced an incorrect undefined error instead of creating implicit
       wires for cases such as:
       assign {a,c} = 2'b10;
       assign a = 1, c = 0;
     * Arrays of enums are now properly initialized at the start of simulation.
     * The write timing command on a Verilog module caused a segmentation
       violation in certain cases.
     * ModelSim crashed with the system function $value$plusargs if the plusarg
       string did not have a format string.
     * In some cases the setuphold and recrem timing checks with negative
       limits (both values) were not being handled properly. Now limits are set
       to zero.
     * Anonymous generate loops and unconditional anonymous generate blocks now
       conform to the external naming convention specified in the Verilog 2005
       LRM.
     * There were problems involving interactions between untyped parameter
       evaluation and generate constructs.
     * Very large times in $setup/$hold timing violation messages are now
       reported  with  the  correct time precision. For example, when the
       resolution and precision is 10 ps, time 45035996273704952 ps will now be
       reported as 45035996273704950 ps rounded to the nearest 10 ps.
     * The simulator crashed with a SIGFPE when performing division on signed
       bit variables with width less than 32.
     * A non-blocking assignment to a hierarchically referenced memory element
       failed to assign the correct value in some cases.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * There were two typos in vpi_user.h. vpiTimeSkew has been corrected to be
       vpiTimeskew, and vpiFullSkew has been corrected to be vpiFullskew.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * On 64-bit platforms, records containing access types had only 32-bits of
       the access type initialized to 0s. In most, but not all, cases the other
       32-bits were also 0s.
     * When type conversion or function expression was used as an actual for
       component  instance, size or length mismatches between actuals and
       formals were not detected. Modelsim now detects such cases and produces
       an appropriate error.
     * If  the user has defined their own functions named rising_edge and
       falling_edge incorrect optimization occurred in some cases.
     * Files declared in protected type bodies now work properly.
     * `path_name and `instance_name attributes now produce correct library
       names  for  subprograms  in packages in libraries other than work.
       Subprogram path name components are now written with a type signature as
       part of the name.
     * The error handling for signal assignment to undeclared identifier was
       not correct. Additional internal error messages are no longer produced.
     * Fatal errors encountered during simulation elaboration will now print
       the line number of the error along with file and scope. To revert to the
       previous message format, or to change the format of the string that is
       printed, modify (and uncomment) the AssertionFormatBreakLine string in
       modelsim.ini.
     * A simulator crash occurred in certain cases when a subprogram containing
       a local array was inlined within another subprogram, which itself was
       inlined within another.
     * There  was  a  problem  in  which  doing  a  toggle add on certain
       std_logic_vector signals would not add all the bits to toggle coverage.
     * There was a compilation crash for the case when the -check_synthesis
       option was used and a subprogram was inlined inside a process and the
       process sensitivity list contained object, which is used in any actual
       expression of the subprogram call.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * sccom crashed when linking in a design library with no SystemC objects.
     * In some cases, when the user does not name his instances, signals or
       ports explicitly SystemC crashed.
     * sccom no longer has a hard include of the current directory. If you need
       to include the current directory then a -I. option must be passed to
       sccom.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.1
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1
     * vsim crashed in certain cases with corrupted memory if branch code
       coverage was on and a Verilog case statement had a case alternative that
       was not a constant, such as a parameter.
     * vopt did not work when library mappings contained Windows style drive
       names.
     * The simulator crashed when signal_force() or $signal_force() was used
       with the restart command.
     * In some cases the simulator spuriously produce the error "Internal Error
       in add_line_object_rec".
     * A memory whose bounds are defined by parameters can be marked as sparse
       in debug (non-vopt) mode. The user needs to use mti_sparse attribute or
       /*sparse*/ metacomment for doing this.
     * The WLFDeleteOnQuit modelsim.ini setting did not work.
     * The mem display command displays a maximum of 1000 lines at a time.
       However, the user can use the mem save command to save the contents of
       larger memories.
     * An error was not detected if a vsim command line generic value (-G or
       -g) was used to set generics of the same name but different types.
     * When -cover c was specified to vlog, long expressions in the Verilog
       code caused vlog to crash in some cases.
     * The use of the -filemap_elab vsim switch caused ModelSim to crash in
       certain situations.
     * The vsim +delayed_timing_checks switch caused a crash due to searching
       for timing checks to move to the delayed net on the wrong nets and then
       failing to find them.
     * vlog -refresh caused a hang and core-dump in certain cases.
     * vsim in certain cases crashed when loading a coverage exclude file if
       the  file contained a line (not a range) that referred to the last
       executable line in the source file.
     * When a SDF statement contains only null values ModelSim did not issue a
       warning. This was particularly a problem in SDF files that had empty
       typical  timing  values,  (e.g.  (3::5)), and -sdftyp was used for
       annotation. In this situation no timing values were annotated and the
       user was not alerted.
     * Environment variables are now fully expanded in files specified with the
       -f option. This applies to vcom, vlog, vopt, sccom and vsim. A new
       modelsim.ini variable can be set to disable this function, although in
       some cases expansion will still occur (the tool will behave as it did in
       previous releases). The .ini file variable is "ExpandEnvVarsInDashF",
       and must be set to a "0" to disable the expansion. The variable must be
       set in the appropriate section of the .ini file ([vcom], [vlog], etc).
     * vcover had a version compatibility problem. When version 6.0b or later
       read a coverage database file from pre-6.0b, it would read it ok and
       process the data ok, but when it wrote the data out, the branch data
       would be in the old format, resulting in loss of data the next time that
       output would be read. This has been fixed.
     * vcover had a version compatibility problem. When version 6.0b or later
       read a coverage database file from pre-6.0b, it would read it ok and
       process the data ok, but when it wrote the data out, the branch data
       would be in the old format, resulting in loss of data the next time that
       output would be read. This has been fixed.

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.1
     * dts0100218049 - Spurious value assigned to generic where there is a type

   Known Defects in 6.1
     * When  condition  coverage  is on, if-condition short-circuiting is
       disabled. All terms in the condition are evaluated.
     * Code coverage has known problems with rtl code in generate blocks.
       (Instances are OK.) As a first step toward fixing these problems we have
       turned off code coverage in all generate blocks. Later we will turn it
       on for just those blocks that are successfully generated.
     * Using the -y option with vlog to compile SystemVerilog source files will
       cause vlog to crash if there are any declarations in $unit scope.
     * Parameters declared in SystemVerilog packages or $unit scope using a
       constant function in the parameter value will cause an internal error in
       vlog.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.1
     * The optimization of Verilog gates is now more aggressive which can
       impact the visibility of primitive gates from the PLI. Users can add
       +acc=m to disable the optimization and preserve the visibility of gates.
       This is normally only an issue if designs have PLI routines that iterate
       over unnamed primitive gates.
     * The modelsim.ini variables ShowIntMem ShowEnumMem and Show3DMem have
       been removed.
     * The following DPI facilities have changed in order to adhere to the IEEE
       P-1800 standard.
          + DPI  import and export declarations use "DPI-C" as their decl
            string.
          + Standard definitions and utilities for packed array data have new
            names and new parameter profiles.
          + Strings passed across language boundaries as parameters observe
            clarified semantics for direction mode.
          + Packed 2-state arrays with a width of 32 or fewer bits are no
            longer  legal  C  function  return value types; as input mode
            parameters they are now passed by reference, rather than by value.
          + DPI applications using the new standard are binary compatible;
            deprecated features for source-level compatibility are no longer
            supported.
     * Three toggle menus "ShowIntMem", "ShowEnumMem" and "Show3DMem" are
       removed from "View" -> "Filter".
     * To reposition or undock a Main window pane, the title double bar is used
       to drag the pane to it's new location. This drag feature has been moved
       to a smaller handle in the center of the title bar. This will reduce
       accidental drag errors when the user wants to move a sash and grabs the
       title bar instead.
     * vopt now prevents the design-unit name specified with the -o switch from
       containing uppercase or non-alphanumeric characters. Previous releases
       did not enforce this restriction, however vopt or vsim might fail subtly
       if such a name was specified.
     * The UserTimeUnit was read from the ini file at the time a design was
       loaded. It is now read during simulator startup.
     * $dumpports  accepts  additional  non-standard arguments to control
       compression, direction, and to ignore the strength range resolution
       required in 1364. These options may also be controlled from the command
       line. In Verilog, only drivers contributing the winning strength value
       are counted to determine which state character to print. The strength
       value for both zero and one are printed if they are the same, otherwise
       only the winning strength is printed. See "Capturing port driver data"
       in the VCD chapter of the User's Manual for more information. Strength
       values were reported incorrectly in some cases.
     * The  Profile window's window type has been changed from profile to
       profilemain. The profile_details window type has been changed from
       profile_details to profiledetails. (See description of view command for
       more information on window type). To view the profile window, type the
       view profilemain command; to view the profile details window, type the
       view profiledetails command. The command view profile will open both
       windows.
     * Prior use of the VHDL package 'util_wc', from the modelsim_lib library,
       will cause library refresh incompatibilities in 6.1. This package was
       first introduced in 6.0b and allowed additional capabilities that are
       now a default part of the 'util' package. Therefore, the 'util_wc'
       package is no longer available in 6.1. The packages mentioned provide
       access to the Signal Spy functions.
     * Unpacked arrays of 2 or 4-state packed arrays are now passed as DPI
       parameters in P1800-compliant fashion, appearing in canonical format for
       imported C routines.
     * The vsim -dpiexportobj flow has changed slightly from 6.0 to 6.1. First,
       you no longer need to use a file extension on the argument you pass to
       -dpiexportobj.  The  system  will automatically add an appropriate
       extension for you. Second, it is no longer necessary to add the -do
       "quit -f" argument to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line. vsim will
       automatically quit if invoked from an OS command shell. vsim will also
       behave properly if invoked from within the simulator's GUI.
     * Prior to 6.1, commands from the -do command line option appeared in the
       transcript exactly as specified in the command line. As of this release,
       multiple commands in the -do option will be split apart and executed
       separately. This way it will be possible to distinguish results printed
       in the transcript for each command.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1
     * Support for continuous assignment to variables (ie, non-nets) has been
       added, including cases where the target is an indexed array, sliced
       array, or field within a struct. Multiple assignments are also detected
       on individual elements and fields. This occurs during compilation when
       possible, otherwise during elaboration.
     * Incremental compilation has been implemented in vopt, and has been made
       the  default.  In  other words, if an existing optimized design is
       specified with the -o option to vopt, it attempts to reuse elements of
       the design that it determines have not changed. This results in a large
       boost  in the performance of vopt when a design has been minimally
       modified.
     * SystemVerilog queues and tagged unions are now supported.
     * SystemVerilog 'ref' ports on modules (but not tasks or functions) are
       supported.
     * The  vlog  and  vopt compilers now accept a -timescale option that
       specifies the default timescale for modules not having an explicit
       timescale directive in effect during compilation. The format of the
       -timescale argument is the same as that of the `timescale directive. For
       example, -timescale "1 ns / 1 ps".
     * Support for source file viewing in view mode has been added.
     * Support for SystemVerilog time-literals has been added. Examples:
       initial #0.023us x = a;
       assign #30000ps y = a;
     * Memtool is now supporting associative array.
     * The simulator now recognizes 'string concatenation' as specified in
       section 7.12 of the LRM: "...if any of the operands is of type string,
       the concatenation is treated as a string, and all other arguments are
       implicitly converted to the string type..."
     * The  "Contains" name filtering currently used for filtering in the
       Objects window is now supported in the Structure view as well. Also, for
       both windows, basic regular expressions (BRE) may be used. BREs have the
       following special characters:
       *
       a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom
       \{m\}
       a sequence of exactly m matches of the atom
       \{m,\}
       a sequence of m or more matches of the atom
       \{m,n\}
       a sequence of m through n (inclusive) matches of the atom; m may not
       exceed n
       The forms using \{ and \} are known as bounds. The numbers m and n are
       unsigned  decimal  integers  with permissible values from 0 to 255
       inclusive.
       An atom is one of:
       \(re\)
       (where re is any regular expression) matches a match for re, with the
       match noted for possible reporting
       \(\)
       matches an empty string, noted for possible reporting
       [chars]
       a bracket expression, matching any one of the chars
       .
       matches any single character
       See the Tcl manual under re_syntax for more detailed information on
       Basic Regular Expressions.
     * The $cast system task/function has been implemented.
     * Individual variables in tasks and functions may now be specified as
       'static' or 'automatic'.
     * The vcover code coverage utility now supports instance-specific toggles
       and summing the instances of each design unit. vcover also now supports
       source code annotation and the printing of condition and expression
       truth tables. The vcover report -dumptables ... option forces printing
       of the truth tables even though fully covered. The -noannotate option
       turns off source code annotation.
     * The "JobSpy" feature is now built into the simulator. Previously it was
       available as an unsupported add-on application. This feature allows
       users to connect to a running simulation and interact with it remotely.
       For more information, refer to the User's Manual.
     * DPI supports strings as imported and exported function return values.
     * Memtool now can save the format of opened memory data panes into the do
       file.
       With this feature, the user can load the do file for memories with
       previous setting. By activating either the memory list window or the
       memory data panes, "File" -> "Save As..." is to save memory format into
       the do file. And "File" -> "Load..." is to load the do file.
     * Support for scope resolution operator has been added. It can be used to
       access items from package, class and $unit scopes .
     * Join_none  and  Join_any  keywords are supported now for fork-join
       construct.
     * The simulator now supports source information for SystemC processes.
     * SystemC global signals, ports, and instances are now debuggable. SystemC
       static  data  members  of  signals,  ports, and instances are also
       debuggable.
     * Debug support was added for SystemC tlm_fifo.
     * The simulator now supports SystemC 2.1. It uses the October 12th, 2004
       beta release of the OSCI SystemC 2.1 reference simulator.
     * SystemC events (sc_event) is supported in the GUI and CLI.
     * The  simulator now includes the header files and examples from the
       approved  OSCI SystemC TLM 1.0(Transaction Level Modeling) Library
       Standard. TLM can be used for simulation with no extra switches or
       files. TLM objects except tlm_fifo are not yet debuggable.
          + Examples and documentation are in examples/systemc/tlm.
          + TLM headers (tlm_*.h) are in include/systemc.
       Example:
       cd examples/systemc/tlm/whitepaper_examples/example_3_2
       sccom -I../../utils -I../basic_protocol -I../user -g \
       main.cc \
       ../user/master.cc ../user/mem_slave.cc \
       ../user/switch_master.cc
       sccom -link
     * PrefMemory(ExpandPackedMem) preference variable is added.
       This  variable  can take values '0' and '1'. The default value '0'
       indicates  that in the Memory window all the packed dimensions are
       treated like a single vector. The value '1' indicates that the packed
       dimensions need to be expanded like any unpacked dimension in the Memory
       window.
     * A new toggle menu "Expand Packed Memories" is added under "View" ->
       "Filter".
     * LRM sections 23.15 - 23.18 for $readmem and $writemem commands have been
       implemented.  The  commands  support packed, associative, dynamic,
       enumerated type and multi-dimensional arrays.
     * The Structure window will now automatically expand the tree when a
       selection is made of a context that is not currently visible. This
       feature can be disabled by setting $PrefStructure(autoExpand) to 0.
     * The Structure window will suppress the implicit wires processes. This
       feature can be disabled by setting PrefStructure(HideImplicitWires) to
       0.
     * sc_export, a SystemC 2.1 feature is now supported for debug in the
       simulator GUI if it is connected to a debuggable channel.
     * vopt now more fully supports VHDL design units. The VHDL compiler (vcom)
       includes the switches -vopt and -novopt which determine whether code is
       produced during compilation or elaboration/optimization. See the Command
       Reference for more information.
     * The simulator can now annotate SDF timing from a compiled SDF file. We
       have observed elaboration time reductions from 25% to 60%. The SDF
       compiler is called "sdfcom" and is documented in the Command Reference.
       A compiled SDF file may be specified on the vsim command line with the
       -sdfmin,  -sdftyp  or  -sdfmax  switch,  or  as  the filename in a
       $sdf_annotate() system task in the Verilog source. Note the following
       limitations:
          + Currently the feature is supported for purely Verilog regions only.
            For example, assume that a VHDL testbench instantiates a Verilog
            module "dut". If all the sub-instances of "dut" are Verilog then
            you  may  annotate  a  compiled SDF file for the region under
            (including) "dut". If the annotated region is not pure Verilog, the
            simulator will issue an error message.
          + This feature is supported in SE only.
     * SystemVerilog bind statement is now supported. bind can be used to bind
       a Verilog design unit to a Verilog design unit or VHDL design unit. Note
       the following limitations:
         1. The actual in the port map is restricted to the following:
               o simple  variable  expression  (e.g.,  reg1, wire1, bit1,
                 std_logic_vector_actual)
               o hierarchical reference when the target is a Verilog design
                 unit (e.g., test.dut.wire1;)
               o Verilog literal (e.g., 1'b1, 4'hf)
               o interface
            Other expressions for the actual are not supported (e.g., 'wire1 &
            wire2' on actual is illegal).
         2. The same restriction holds for parameter mapping. It can either be
            a  simple parameter expression, a hierarchical reference to a
            parameter, a literal, or a parametrized type.
         3. Hier ref from target into bind instance is not allowed but hier ref
            from bind instance into target is allowed.
         4. When binding Verilog to VHDL, the same mixed language restrictions
            apply as making direct instance.
         5. bind  statements are allowed in module, interface and program
            blocks.  It  is  not  allowed in compilation unit scope. This
            restriction should be lifted by 6.1 production.
         6. The  instance that is being bound cannot contain another bind
            statement.
         7. The  target  of  the bind can either be a VHDL entity or VHDL
            entity(arch) pair. To specify a complete VHDL design unit, the same
            escaping  mechanism is used as when instantiating VHDL inside
            Verilog (i.e., \lib.ent(arch)).
         8. When  the target is a VHDL entity, then the bound instance is
            created under the last compiled architecture.
         9. ". named" port connections work in cases where the target is VHDL
            or Verilog, but ".*" works only when the target is Verilog.
        10. Although VHDL does not allow reading of an out port, the out port
            can  be  used in the actual of the bind statement. In case of
            multiple drivers on an out, it is not guaranteed that the bind
            instance will get either the unresolved contribution or the final
            resolved value. Depending on how the ports are collapsed, the value
            read can be the partially resolved value.
     * New key bindings have been added to the main window U/I:
          + F2: Move Active pane to the previous pane.
          + Shift-F2: Move Active pane to the next pane.
          + F3: Toggle zoom mode of current Active pane.
       The F2 and Shift-F2 keys work in zoom mode also.
     * The coverage save command has a new option -onexit, which when specified
       will cause the command to be executed when the simulator exits.
     * The toggle report command has a new option -onexit, which when specified
       causes the command to be executed when the simulator exits.
     * The  toggle  add  command has a new option -exclude {<list>} which
       specifies that bits of a bus be excluded from toggle computations and
       reports. <list> is a space-separated list of integers or ranges, where a
       range is two integers separated by either ":" or "-". The range must be
       in the same ascending or descending order as the signal declaration. If
       a second toggle add -exclude command is issued on the same signal, the
       latest command will override the earlier one.
     * SystemVerilog Clocking Blocks are now supported except for Hierarchical
       expressions, Clocking block events, and Synchronous drives.
     * SystemVerilog Final Blocks are now supported.
     * A  new command, dataset config, may be used to view or set dataset
       configurations  mid-simulation. Available options include -wlfopt,
       -wlfdeleteonquit, and -wlfcachesize. See the Command Reference for
       detailed usage.
     * WLF Reader Caching has been implemented for 6.1. WLF reader caching
       caches blocks of the WLF file to reduce redundant file I/O. This should
       have significant benefit to customers with slow networks. By default
       caching  is  turned  off.  It can be enabled with the WLFCacheSize
       modelsim.ini variable or the vsim -wlfcachesize switch. Both the ini
       variable and the command line switch take a size value which is the
       number of megabytes to allocate for the cache. The allocated size is on
       a per WLF file basis. The size may be controlled within the GUI using
       the dataset config command.
     * The  restart, checkpoint, and restore commands now work on designs
       containing  SystemVerilog  DPI constructs. vsim -restore (aka Cold
       Restore) works as well.
       Note that for user DPI C code that works with heap memory, care should
       be taken to use mti_Malloc() rather than raw malloc() or new. Any memory
       allocated with mti_Malloc() is guaranteed to be correctly restored
       during checkpoint restore. Any memory allocated with raw malloc will not
       be restored correctly. Simulator crashes can result in that case.
     * The  profile  report  command has a new option -onexit, which when
       specified will cause the command to be executed when the simulator
       exits.
     * A new source code pragma has been added for excluding bits of buses from
       toggle coverage. The format for Verilog is:
       // coverage toggle_ignore <simple_signal_name> "<list>"
       and for vhdl:
       -- coverage toggle_ignore <simple_signal_name> "<list>"
       where <list> is a space-separated list of bit indices or ranges, where a
       range is two integers separated by ':' or '-'. The range must be in the
       same ascending or descending order as the signal declaration. Quotes are
       required  around  the  list.  The pragma must be placed within the
       declarative   region  of  the  module  or  architecture  in  which
       <simple_signal_name> is declared.
     * New  simulator license exclusion switches to be used with the vsim
       command:
          + lic_no_slvhdl (don't checkout qhsimvh or vsim license features)
          + lic_no_slvlog  (don't  checkout  qhsimvl or vsim-vlog license
            features)
          + lic_no_mix (don't checkout msimhdlmix or hdlmix license features)
          + lic_no_lnl (don't checkout msimhdlsim or hdlsim license features)
          + lic_mixed_only (don't checkout qhsimvh, vsim, qhsimvl, or vsim-vlog
            license features)
          + lic_lnl_only (don't checkout qhsimvh, vsim, qhsimvl, vsim-vlog,
            msimhdlmix, or hdlmix)
       There are also corresponding settings in the License section of the
       modelsim.ini file:
          + noslvhdl
          + noslvlog
          + nomix
          + nolnl
          + mixedonly
          + lnlonly
     * Automatic command help has been added to the GUI command prompt. When a
       command is typed in at the prompt, a dropdown box is shown listing the
       available commands matching what has been typed so far. The Up and Down
       arrow keys, or the mouse may be used to select the desired command. When
       a unique command has been entered, the command usage is presented in the
       drop down box.
       This feature can be disabled by setting PrefMain(EnableCommandHelp) to
       0; it is enabled by default.
     * Verilog bind can now exist in unit scope. It should be noted that when
       bind is in unit scope, the bind only becomes effective when that unit
       package gets elaborated by vsim. And package gets elaborated only when a
       design unit that depends on that package gets elaborated. So if a user
       has only binds in a file in unit scope and he tries to compile that file
       standalone, the file will compile fine but the binds will never get
       elaborated.  A warning to this effect is generated by vlog if bind
       statements are found in unit scope but there are no top level modules.
     * Verilog  bind now allows portmapping a VHDL enum to a Verilog port
       vector. The port vector can be of any size less then or equal to 32.
       This  portmapping is supported for both input and output port. The
       integer value of the enum is first converted to a bit vector before
       connecting  to Verilog formal port. Note that you cannot connect a
       literal enum value as an actual, rather the actual has to be a signal.
       This kind of portmapping between VHDL enum and Verilog vector is only
       allowed when the Verilog is instantiated under VHDL through bind and is
       not supported in case of a normal instantiation.
     * DPI  export  and  import of task and function declarations are now
       supported in package and global scope.
     * A new program called qverilog which has been added to provide a one
       stop,  out of the box, optimized compile and simulation of Verilog
       designs.
     * The view command has two new features: view without any arguments will
       return a list of window class names of all the windows currently open;
       and view with one or more options and no window classes or window names
       specified will apply the options to the currently open windows. To
       undock all currently viewed windows, use the command view -undock.
     * The find instances command now displays the primary design unit name.
     * A new modelsim.ini variable CoverageNoSub has been added to turn off
       code coverage in VHDL subprograms. The compiler option can be set also
       from the GUI compile options dialog under the Coverage tab.
     * SystemC now includes additional type support with mixed languages:
          + sc_bigint/sc_biguint
          + sc_signed/sc_unsigned
          + sc_fixed/sc_ufixed
          + sc_fixed_fast/sc_ufixed_fast
          + sc_fix/sc_ufix
          + sc_fix_fast/sc_ufix_fast
          + short/unsigned short
          + long long/unsigned long long
          + float
          + double
     * qverilog one-step compile and simulate supports the SystemVerilog Direct
       Programming Interface (DPI) feature. Consult the user documentation for
       more information on qverilog.
     * Sometimes the toggle report command would show additional signals than
       the  coverage  report  command, due to objects declared in Verilog
       functions and tasks. A new option -toggleNoSubs has been added to vsim
       to turn off toggle coverage for objects declared within functions and
       tasks.
     * A memory within a Verilog struct or VHDL record is identified as a
       memory. A static member of a class that is a memory is also identified
       as a memory.
     * Unpacked arrays of packed struct and packed unions are identified as
       memories.
     * View source opens files in read only mode by default. To view source
       files in edit mode, the user can set PrefSource(ReadOnly) to zero.
     * The Verilog file I/O system task $feof had been implemented.
     * The simulator now supports multiple user-defined window layouts. The
       size, position and visibility of all windows can be saved as a layout.
       The window layouts can be loaded at any time, and are controlled via a
       new Window->Layout menu. Refer to the GUI Reference manual for more
       details.
     * System Verilog time-literals in assignments are now supported. For
       example:
       time t = 5ns;
     * The BIDIRECTSKEW statement from SDF 4.0 is now supported. (NETDELAY and
       LABEL are not yet supported).
     * Prior to 6.1, user interface preferences were stored in a file, on
       unix/linux in the users HOME directory, and in the registry on Windows.
       Starting in this release the user can define where these preferences
       should  be  stored.  This  is  done using the MODELSIM_PREFERENCES
       environment variable. Setting this variable with the path of a file will
       cause ModelSim to use this file instead of the default location. The
       file does not need to exist beforehand, ModelSim will initialize it.
       Also, if this file is read-only, ModelSim will not update or otherwise
       modify the file. This variable may contain a relative pathname and in
       this case the file will be relative to the working directory at the time
       the tool is started.
