   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The automatic invocation of the design-wide performance optimization
       tool "vopt" has been enabled. Upon invocation, the simulator determines
       if vopt has been run on the top-level module(s) you supplied; if not,
       the simulator invokes vopt and outputs a message similar to:
       # ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized...
       The optimization step will improve run time performance and affect the
       visibility of objects in the design. To enable debug visibility it is
       recommended you add additional options to vopt on the vsim invocation
       via the -voptargs argument. For example: vsim -voptargs="+acc" which
       enables  full  debug access to objects in the optimized design. To
       understand the full usage of +acc and -voptargs, please refer to the
       chapter "Optimizing Designs with vopt" in the User's Manual for more
       information.
       If required you may obtain the previous behavior of vsim, where it does
       not perform performance optimizations, by setting the modelsim.ini
       variable "VoptFlow" to 0 (zero). An alternative to setting VoptFlow to
       zero, where interactive debug compile throughput is required you can use
       the -novopt option on the vsim and compilation command line (vcom/vlog).
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.3 release:
          + HPUX Platforms - hp700, hppa64
          + AIX Platforms - rs6000, rs64
       The following platforms are discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DPI using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.1x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * As of release 6.3, the linux versions of gcc 3.2.3 and 3.3 compilers
       will be replaced with version 4.0.2. This means that gcc 3.2.X and 3.3
       will  not  be supported or distributed as of release 6.3. Only the
       following versions will be supported in 6.3:
          + gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
          + gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
          + gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
          + gcc-3.3-sunos58
          + gcc-3.3-sunos59
          + gcc-3.3-sunos510
       In order to facilitate an easy transition for users, both gcc 3 and gcc
       4 will be supported and distributed in release 6.2. Since support for
       64-bit SystemC on linux_x86_64 was added in release 6.2, linux_x86_64
       will  only  be supported with the gcc 4.0.2 release. The following
       versions are supported in 6.2:
          + gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
          + gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
          + gcc-3.2.3-rhe21
          + gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
          + gcc-3.3-sunos58
          + gcc-3.3-sunos59
          + gcc-3.3-sunos510
       The  is no change on the hp700 platform and it will continue to be
       supported with aCC 3.45.
       Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions.
       OS dependencies are slightly different for designs with and without
       SystemC content.
       Supported Operating Systems for designs with SystemC content:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater (simulation environment version 5.8b
            and greater)
          + Solaris 8, 9, and 10
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater
          + Win32 XP and 2000 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The product documentation contains a new look and feel for this release.
       You will find links to the documentation in your Help dropdown menu. PDF
       documentation is available from the PDF Bookcase menu item and HTML
       documentation (if shipped with the product) is available from the Help &

   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * Using the waveform editor to create a constant wave caused a crash.
     * A WLF dataset snapshot bug caused the snapshotting to become disabled
       under some circumstances.
     * In some situations when single stepping in functions or tasks outside of
       the current module, the examine command did not find local variables or
       returned bad results. The correction also changes situations where
       examine correctly returns process local variables even though no process
       is selected. It is now necessary to select or name a process in order to
       examine locals within that context.
     * Toggle Coverage menu picks are now available at all times, not just when
       the Objects window is active.
     * If  a project contained files that had spaces in the pathname, the
       compile status would incorrectly be displayed as "out-of-date".
     * The "dataset close" function crashed in certain cases if a virtual
       signal was currently displayed in the Objects window and the command
       dataset close -all was issued.
     * The JobSpy Job Manager user interface dialog was not resizable.
     * The Wave window crashed in some cases if the window was closed while
       waves were actively drawing.
     * The examine command failed on variables inside procedures defined in
       VHDL packages.
     * There were problems with the GUI "Customize" feature where the buttons
       were not added, errors were produced, or the U/I locked up. This feature
       is  found  under  the  Windows  menu,  or  when using the commands
       apply_button_adder or add_menu.
     * A memory leak has been repaired that would cause the U/I to run out of
       resources  and  either  hang or crash the simulator after multiple
       simulation runs during a single session.
     * A  Tcl error occurred when you clicked "OK" in the library mapping
       dialog.
     * When the Wave window was zoomed on from inside the MDI, the next time
       the simulator was invoked the Main window appeared all gray.
     * "dataset open" now loads the Msgviewer window. The Msgviewer window only
       supports one dataset at a time.
     * The simulator crashed in some cases if a NULL SystemVerilog class was
       expanded in the Locals window.
     * Breakpoints could not be added to the Source window if the source file
       was opened before the design was loaded.
     * qverilog no longer consumes two vsim licenses when invoked from the GUI.
     * Viewing class variables in the Objects window or Watch window crashed in
       some cases when NULL references were present.
     * The Structure window and consequently, other windows, could not find
       processes such as forks in some cases.
     * The Source Annotation feature did not draw values when used in -view
       mode on the Windows platform.
     * There was an issue related to SystemVerilog typedefs declared within
       parameterized class definitions which resulted in an infinite loop in
       commands that recursively descended into the class such as add wave -r *
       or Edit->Expand All. This was originally reported on the tlm_fifo class
       type.
     * In some cases hovering over the Source window caused the tool to crash.
     * The main menu did not update to reflect the Wave window being active
       when the wave tab was clicked on in the MDI area.
     * Dragging a signal from the Source window to the Wave window took a very
       long time.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * Direct  specification of parameterized class handle types (without
       typedef) in extern method definitions are now supported.
     * During compilation of designs containing libmaps by vopt, occasionally,
       a design unit for which no libmap applied was compiled into a library
       different from the work library. In this case, the simulator was unable
       to find the design unit's generated machine code, and issued a fatal
       error. This issue occurred on 32-bit platforms, but was more prevalent
       on 64-bit platforms.
     * When the simulator was invoked on a list of designs of which at least
       one was a Verilog package, and the vopt flow was employed (the simulator
       implicitly invokes vopt), the simulator reported the following internal
       error:
       ** INTERNAL ERROR: vopt returned success but vsim could not find a
       design to simulate!
     * Evaluation of casex statements containing all-literal selectors in
       certain cases produced indeterminate results when the value of the case
       expression contained X or Z bits.
     * The command coverage report -du did not produce the correct data for
       Verilog registers.
     * The  ability  to  suppress  the Verilog error "Edge not allowed in
       level-sensitive path" was inadvertently disabled. This Verilog error can
       again  be  suppressed by downgrading the error severity to note or
       warning.
     * A compile or vopt fatal error was encountered if a class inheritance
       hierarchy was alternated between parameterized classes and regular
       classes.
     * There  was a problem related to class data members whose types are
       dependent on type parameters that sometimes caused the value of those
       data members to be invalid or crash vsim.
     * In some cases part-select expressions used inside of generate blocks and
       parameterized classes incorrectly reported errors about the type of the
       part-select. For example:
       "Cannot mix packed and unpacked types in this operation."
     * An always block that read a PSL endpoint would not work correctly if the
       always block was optimized.
     * A part-select having bounds expressions containing parameters crashed
       vopt if the referenced vector was assigned a constant with a continuous
       assignment  and  if  the  optimizer chose to retain handles to the
       parameters (or, if the user forced retention of parameter handles with
       +acc=g).
     * A bit-select of a vector net having an index expression containing
       parameters on the rhs of a continuous assignment resulted in an internal
       vopt error if the optimizer chose to retain handles to the parameters
       (or, if the user forced retention of parameter handles with +acc=g).
     * vopt consumed excessive memory in optimizing some designs having many
       large concatenations connected to module ports.
     * When  $cast()  was used as a task and an error was reported it was
       reported as a fatal error and simulation was stopped. It is now a normal
       error  and  simulation continues without modifying the destination
       variable.
     * In certain cases vlog -source crashed when attempting to print a source
       line with a warning or error message.
     * SystemVerilog   code  containing  variable  declarations  with  an
       initialization assignment produced the following error message in some
       contexts:
       ** Error: Variable declaration assignments are only allowed at the
       module level or if the variables are automatic.
       The initial value assignment is now allowed in all scopes.
     * The simulator incorrectly handled 2-state variables when generating VCD
       files. In some cases the VCD output contained 'X' and 'Z' values.
     * In some conditions, $fullskew violated when simultaneous input events
       occurred.
     * SystemVerilog bind to interface generated the error message "object not
       found" for instance actuals.
     * In some cases when bit-stream cast was used to cast a class variable
       containing a dynamic array, an incorrect error was reported about a size
       mismatch for the cast.
     * Unless the remain_active_flag is set, $fullskew will now become dormant
       after a violation is reported or after the timing check is satisfied.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * SystemVerilog packed structures and packed multi-dimension arrays are
       now supported by acc_fetch_range, acc_fetch_value, and acc_set_value in
       the same manner as equivalent vectors.
     * The acc_fetch_size routine returned incorrect results or crashed for
       some types of SystemVerilog objects.
     * The acc_set_value routine now supports SystemVerilog 2-state types
       (acc_fetch_value had already supported 2-state types).
     * The  acc_object_of_type routine now returns TRUE for the accVector
       property for SystemVerilog objects that are packed structures or packed
       multi-dimension arrays.
     * The acc_handle_tfarg routine now returns a handle of type accPartSelect
       for  a  part-select  of  a  register type argument. Previously, an
       accPartSelect handle was returned only for a part-select of vector net,
       and a NULL handle was returned for a part-select of a vector register.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * A compiler optimization applied to assignment statements with circular
       references  through attribute expressions resulted in the compiler
       consuming all memory, and issuing a fatal error. The assignments that
       triggered this fault have the following properties:
          + The statement is evaluated whenever the enclosing subprogram or
            process is evaluated.
          + There is no other assignment to the statement's target preceding
            the assignment statement.
          + The  target  of the assignment is a variable. An example of a
            circular reference is the following (where foo is a function call):
            v := foo(v'length);
     * Changed the vcom error message text to include the buffer port name in
       error messages that indicate multiple sources are present with buffer
       port connections.
     * vopt  failed  on the following construct: for A_VARIABLE in A_TYPE
       generate.
     * vopt sometimes incorrectly ignored generic maps and set generics to
       their default values when entities contained generics with implicit
       subtypes, such as ranges.
     * The 'event signal attribute produced a simulator crash for certain
       partial atomic signals.
     * Large VHDL files meeting certain pathological criteria could take an
       inordinately long time to compile. The compiler has been made more
       efficient, resulting in smaller compile times.
     * Processing by vopt incorrectly reported bounds errors in instances of
       design  units  within indeterminate conditional generates and loop
       generates. The bounds errors involve expressions containing generics for
       which constant values are inferred. It is incorrect to report errors,
       because elaboration-time evaluation of the enclosing generate statements
       may result in the instances with bounds errors not being loaded by the
       simulator. The bounds errors are now reported as warnings.
     * If a change was made to a configured architecture, vopt failed to detect
       the dependence of the configuration on the architecture, and did not
       regenerate the configuration. As a result, the simulator detected a
       dependence conflict and issued the following error:
       ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.config because work.ent(arch) has
       changed.
       Additional recompiles do not resolve the error.
     * A procedure with an array type out or inout mode signal parameter had
       sometimes caused a crash because of two conflicting optimizations.
     * Designs using configurations could have seen load errors during refresh
       or vopt optimization. The design units that had errors had compiled
       correctly with the -novitalcheck option, but the configuration was not
       compiled  with this option. The incorrect setting of options while
       loading dependencies was the root cause of this error.
     * In  mixed  language  designs,  vopt incorrectly skipped processing
       instantiations that followed a conditional generate whose condition
       evaluated to FALSE when the condition involved generics with values that
       had been inferred to be constants.
     * vopt crashed if the condition expression in an if statement was an
       inline function call.
     * If an undeclared identifier was used in a slice, the compiler crashed
       instead of reporting the identifier as being undefined.
     * If an assert within a block statement referenced, direct or indirect,
       the signal attributes 'EVENT or 'LAST_EVENT the simulator crashed in
       some cases.
     * Under some conditions, the attributes 'EVENT and 'LAST_EVENT were not
       correctly computed for array signals.

     * In the Wave window, the value of a transaction attribute could have
       leaked into a prior transaction if both occupied the same stream (and
       sub-stream) and the start of the second was in the same time and delta
       as the first.

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * Optimization  (vopt)  of a design having large Verilog hierarchies
       instantiated underneath VHDL consumed excessive memory and time in some
       cases.
     * Logic changes were not propagating on a forced or released Verilog I/0
       port that is connected to a VHDL I/0 port.
     * The simulator no longer fails to "find machine code" when SystemVerilog
       instantiates VHDL using an interface after optimization with vopt has
       been done.
     * When  loading an optimized design, VHDL instances were incorrectly
       reported as having no default binding. The generic reported as missing
       on the entity did not exist at the instantiation point.
     * Verilog packages and interfaces are no longer visible to VHDL design
       units. Prior releases treated this as an error, so the statement
       USE WORK.ALL
       generated an error if a package or interface was present in the library
       even if it was not actually used.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.2b
     * A report generated via the profile report -onexit ... command failed to
       have any samples if the simulation was ended via a $finish statement.
     * The command vcover report -byfile -zeros ... ignored the -zeros option
       when the input data was in pre-UCDB format.
     * The jobspy utility did not have a link in the .../modeltech/bin/vco
       directory.
     * The  vcover  report -xml command produced incorrect conditions and
       expression  statistics.  This was a result of the active count not
       including exclusions.
     * vsim crashed when the -nopsl switch was used and a VHDL process was
       sensitive to an endpoint.
     * Attempts to use associative arrays, class objects or SystemVerilog
       queues as DPI parameters are detected during compilation and appropriate
       error messages are issued.
     * Line  numbers within the expansion of a multi-line macro body were
       misleading.
     * An attempt to use a DPI parameter with a ref direction mode resulted in
       a misleading error message; a DPI-specific message is now issued.

     * Some links from the Syntax section of command reference pages in the PDF
       version  of  the  Reference  Manual do not resolve to the specific

       Workaround: Use the HTML version of the Reference Manual available from
       Help > Help & Manuals.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.2b
     * Due to customer requests, statement coverage has been added for VHDL
       concurrent  conditional  signal  assignments  and  selected signal
       assignments.
     * The User Interface was modified to suppress the display of implicit
       wires in the Structure and Process windows. The debugger will not step
       into implicit wire processes when the display of implicit wires is
       suppressed.  This behavior is controlled by a preference variable,
       PrefMain(HideImplicitWires). When this variable is set to 0 (zero) it
       displays implicit wires and allows the debugger to step into them and
       when it is set to 1 (the default), it hides them and suppresses debugger
       interaction with them.
     * Breakpoint and Fatal error messages have changed. They now display the
       name of the function, task, subprogram, module, or architecture where
       the condition occurred, in addition to the file and line number. This
       additional information should make it easier to debug. This old message
       format  can be enabled for backward compatibility by modifying the
       modelsim.ini variable ShowFunctions. Setting this to 0 will revert the
       messages to the previous format.
     * The see command has been enhanced. It will now accept 1 or 2 arguments.
       These arguments are the number of source file lines to display before
       and after the current execution line. The see command has also been made
       available in GUI mode in addition to command line mode.
       see ;# Display source file lines around the current execution line
           ;# By default 5 lines before and 4 lines after are displayed
       see <n> ;# Display <n> lines before and after the current line.
       see <pre> <post> ;# Display <pre> line before and <post> lines
           ;# after the current line
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.2b
     * $root as the prefix for a hierarchical name is now supported.
     * DPI import and export tfs are supported in generate loop scopes.
     * Cdebug support for conditional C breakpoint is added. To specify the
       condition expression of a C breakpoint, use the bp command and switch
       -cond <cond-expression>. For example:
       bp -c -cond "x < 5" foo.c 10
       The  breakpoint query command bp will report the current condition
       expression if there is one. In the same example as above, bp reports:
       Id c.1 File foo.c line 10 Status Enabled Cond {stop only if x<5}
     * The new command wave configcursor has been added to get or set the name,
       time or lock state of a wave cursor. Additionally, the -name and -lock
       switches were added to the "wave addcursor" to allow setting of these
       configurations at the time the cursor is added.
     * The constraint solver now includes an optimization for '==' constraints.
       For constraints like "x == y % z;", where there are no other constraints
       on 'x' this can yield a significant performance increase. Note: this may
       change the random sequences produced, compared to the previous release.
       (see vsim -solverev).
     * vsim now has an option to specify random sequence compatibility with a
       previous  letter release. Use the -solverev command line option or
       "SolveRev" in the modelsim.ini file.
     * SystemC DPI users can now register SystemC member import function for
       multiple SystemC module instances using the same global function name.
       Two built-in SystemVerilog functions are provided to control the calling
       scope of SystemC on runtime:
       function string scSetScopeByName(input string sc_scope_name);
       function string scGetScopeName();
       Please refer to the latest User Guide, Section "SystemC Procedural
       Interface to SystemVerilog" in Chapter "SystemC Simulation", for more
       details.
     * The vcover merge -du <du_fullname> option has been implemented under
       UCDB, where <du_fullname> is of the form library.primary(secondary),
       where library can be left out if it is "work", and secondary can be left
       out if it is Verilog. This option merges all instances of the specified
       design  unit  in  all  the input files, and creates an output file
       consisting of one instance of the design unit, containing all the merged
       data. The instance name of the output is the name of the first instance
       encountered in the input files.
     * sccom accepts the -nodebug switch which disables creation of the debug
       database for modules defined in those source files. With -nodebug, sccom
       does not run the sparse compiler which creates the debug database. All
       files containing the SC_MODULE_EXPORT() macro call must be compiled
       without the -nodebug switch otherwise the design will not load. Using
       this option reduces the compile time for a design significantly and may
       be useful for users running designs in regression mode who are not
       trying to debug a design. It is also helpful for users trying to create
       a library(.a) from the object files (.o) created by sccom that they will
       link later with the SystemC shared object.
     * The  coverage exclude command is supported in viewcov mode for all
       coverage types except toggles.
     * A new Call Stack view is available. This window will display the current
       call  stack  when  single  stepping or when a breakpoint is hit. A
       Double-Click on a stack entry will cause the Locals window to display
       the local variables at that level and the corresponding source code will
       be displayed in the Source window. To open this window, select menu
       View->Call Stack.
       Currently this window must be opened manually with each new invocation
       of ModelSim, as the layout information is not saved. This is done for
       backward compatibility with prior 6.2 and earlier releases. This problem
       will be fixed in release 6.3.
     * JobSpy now accepts the force command to force signal values in a remote
       simulation.
     * Added two functions to the FLI to format time values into strings in
       order to provide formatting equivalent to the display in the vsim GUI.
       The new functions are mti_NowFormatted(), which returns the current
       simulation  time  formatted  according  to  specified  flags,  and
       mti_TimeToString(), which supplies a time argument instead of using the
       current simulation time. See the mti.h file for arguments and flag
       definitions.
