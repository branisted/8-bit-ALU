<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The automatic invocation of the design-wide performance optimization tool "vopt" has been enabled. Upon invocation, the simulator determines if vopt has been run on the top-level module(s) you supplied; if not, the simulator invokes vopt and outputs a message similar to: 
<br>
# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized... 
<br>
The optimization step will improve run time performance and affect the visibility of objects in the design. To enable debug visibility it is recommended you add additional options to vopt on the vsim invocation via the -voptargs argument.  For example: vsim <b>-voptargs</b>="+acc" which enables full debug access to objects in the optimized design. To understand the full usage of <b>+acc</b> and <b>-voptargs</b>, please refer to the chapter "Optimizing Designs with vopt" in the User's Manual for more information. 
<br>
If required you may obtain the previous behavior of vsim, where it does not perform performance optimizations, by setting the modelsim.ini variable "VoptFlow" to 0 (zero). An alternative to setting VoptFlow to zero, where interactive debug compile throughput is required you can use the <b>-novopt</b> option on the vsim and compilation command line (vcom/vlog).</li>
<li>
The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
<br>
The support includes the following platforms:
<br>
<ul>
<li>32-bit linux
<li>64-bit linux_x86_64 
</ul>
<p>
For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under the section Supported platforms.</li>
<li>
The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.3 release:
<ul>
<li>HPUX Platforms - hp700, hppa64
<li>AIX Platforms - rs6000, rs64
</ul>
The following platforms are discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Windows 98
<li>Windows ME
<li>Windows NT 4.0
<li>Solaris 2.6
<li>Solaris 7
<li>AIX 4.3
</ul></li>
<li>
Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.

<UL>Solaris 10 has the following limitations:

<LI>In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between 20ms and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error message, "Too few samples."  To workaround this problem, add the following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:<br>
set hires_tick=1<br>
This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris releases.
<LI>In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the system and produce a messages like "nfs server array not responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6296698.
<LI>In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any  PLI/FLI/DPI using g7 will break under Solaris 10.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 6.1x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is supported.  Therefore, we only read in compressed SDF files that are created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
As of release 6.3, the linux versions of gcc 3.2.3 and 3.3 compilers will be replaced with version 4.0.2. This means that gcc 3.2.X and 3.3 will not be supported or distributed as of release 6.3. Only the following versions will be supported in 6.3:
<ul>
<li>gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
<li>gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
<li>gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos58
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos59
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos510
</ul>
In order to facilitate an easy transition for users, both gcc 3 and gcc 4 will be supported and distributed in release 6.2. Since support for 64-bit SystemC on linux_x86_64 was added in release 6.2, linux_x86_64 will only be supported with the gcc 4.0.2 release. The following versions are supported in 6.2:
<ul>
<li>gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
<li>gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
<li>gcc-3.2.3-rhe21
<li>gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos58
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos59
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos510
</ul>
The is no change on the hp700 platform and it will continue to be supported with aCC 3.45.<br>

Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions and C++ compiler versions.
<br>
OS dependencies are slightly different for designs with and without SystemC content.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems for designs with SystemC content:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater (simulation environment version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>Solaris 8, 9, and 10</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches <b>-87</b>, <b>-93</b>, or <b>-2002</b>, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>
The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5; Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
<p>
CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
<p>
For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software
being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
(i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
need to do anything.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit() task.</li>
<li>
The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit" variable in the modelsim.ini file.  By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.  The default time unit in SystemC can also be set using the sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like sc_clock or sc_time is created.</li>
<li>
vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar to the vsim command line options.</li>
<li>
Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option
has changed behavior somewhat.  This primarily affects
win32 and rs6000 users.

<OL>
<LI>You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename.
   That will be done for you automatically now.</LI>

<LI>There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'"
   to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line.</LI>
</OL>
The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat
files have been modified to show the correct flow now.
</li>
<li>
Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher will not
run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:<br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).<br>
# Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled<br>
# version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library<br>
# was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make<br>
# sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.<br>
</code></li>
<li>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Using the waveform editor to create a constant wave caused a crash.</li>
<li>
A WLF dataset snapshot bug caused the snapshotting to become disabled under some circumstances.</li>
<li>
In some situations when single stepping in functions or tasks outside of the current module, the <b>examine</b> command did not find local variables or returned bad results. The correction also changes situations where <b>examine</b> correctly returns process local variables even though no process is selected. It is now necessary to select or name a process in order to examine locals within that context.</li>
<li>
Toggle Coverage menu picks are now available at all times, not just when the Objects window is active.</li>
<li>
If a project contained files that had spaces in the pathname, the compile status would incorrectly be displayed as "out-of-date".</li>
<li>
The "dataset close" function crashed in certain cases if a virtual signal was currently displayed in the Objects window and the command <b>dataset close -all</b> was issued.</li>
<li>
The JobSpy Job Manager user interface dialog was not resizable.</li>
<li>
The Wave window crashed in some cases if the window was closed while waves were actively drawing.</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b> command failed on variables inside procedures defined in VHDL packages.</li>
<li>
There were problems with the GUI "Customize" feature where the buttons were not added, errors were produced, or the U/I locked up.  This feature is found under the Windows menu, or when using the commands <b>apply_button_adder</b> or <b>add_menu</b>.</li>
<li>
A memory leak has been repaired that would cause the U/I to run out of resources and either hang or crash the simulator after multiple simulation runs during a single session.</li>
<li>
A Tcl error occurred when you clicked "OK" in the library mapping dialog.</li>
<li>
When the Wave window was zoomed on from inside the MDI, the next time the simulator was invoked the Main window appeared all gray.</li>
<li>
"dataset open" now loads the Msgviewer window. The Msgviewer window only supports one dataset at a time.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in some cases if a NULL SystemVerilog class was expanded in the Locals window.</li>
<li>
Breakpoints could not be added to the Source window if the source file was opened before the design was loaded.</li>
<li>
qverilog no longer consumes two vsim licenses when invoked from the GUI.</li>
<li>
Viewing class variables in the Objects window or Watch window crashed in some cases when NULL references were present.</li>
<li>
The Structure window and consequently, other windows, could not find processes such as forks in some cases.</li>
<li>
The Source Annotation feature did not draw values when used in -view mode on the Windows platform.</li>
<li>
There was an issue related to SystemVerilog typedefs declared within parameterized class definitions which resulted in an infinite loop in commands that recursively descended into the class such as <b>add wave -r *</b> or Edit->Expand All. This was originally reported on the tlm_fifo class type.</li>
<li>
In some cases hovering over the Source window caused the tool to crash.</li>
<li>
The main menu did not update to reflect the Wave window being active when the wave tab was clicked on in the MDI area.</li>
<li>
Dragging a signal from the Source window to the Wave window took a very long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Direct specification of parameterized class handle types (without typedef) in extern method definitions are now supported.
</li>
<li>
During compilation of designs containing libmaps by vopt, occasionally, a design unit for which no libmap applied was compiled into a library different from the work library. In this case, the simulator was unable to find the design unit's generated machine code, and issued a fatal error. This issue occurred on 32-bit platforms, but was more prevalent on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>
When the simulator was invoked on a list of designs of which at least one was a Verilog package, and the vopt flow was employed (the simulator implicitly invokes vopt), the simulator reported the following internal error:<br>
<code>
** INTERNAL ERROR: vopt returned success but vsim could not find a design to simulate!
</code></li>
<li>
Evaluation of casex statements containing all-literal selectors in certain cases produced indeterminate results when the value of the case expression contained X or Z bits.</li>
<li>
The command <b>coverage report -du</b> did not produce the correct data for Verilog registers. </li>
<li>
The ability to suppress the Verilog error "Edge not allowed in level-sensitive path" was inadvertently disabled. This Verilog error can again be suppressed by downgrading the error severity to note or warning.</li>
<li>
A compile or vopt fatal error was encountered if a class inheritance hierarchy was alternated between parameterized classes and regular classes.
</li>
<li>
There was a problem related to class data members whose types are dependent on type parameters that sometimes caused the value of those data members to be invalid or crash vsim.</li>
<li>
In some cases part-select expressions used inside of generate blocks and parameterized classes incorrectly reported errors about the type of the part-select. For example: <br> 
<code>
"Cannot mix packed and unpacked types in this operation."
</code></li>
<li>
An always block that read a PSL endpoint would not work correctly 
if the always block was optimized.</li>
<li>
A part-select having bounds expressions containing parameters crashed vopt if the referenced vector was assigned a constant with a continuous assignment and if the optimizer chose to retain handles to the parameters (or, if the user forced retention of parameter handles with <b>+acc=g</b>).</li>
<li>
A bit-select of a vector net having an index expression containing parameters on the rhs of a continuous assignment resulted in an internal vopt error if the optimizer chose to retain handles to the parameters (or, if the user forced retention of parameter handles with <b>+acc=g</b>).</li>
<li>
vopt consumed excessive memory in optimizing some designs having many large concatenations connected to module ports.</li>
<li>
When $cast() was used as a task and an error was reported it was reported as a fatal error and simulation was stopped.  It is now a normal error and simulation continues without modifying the destination variable.</li>
<li>
In certain cases <b>vlog -source</b> crashed when attempting to print a source line with a warning or error message.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog code containing variable declarations with an initialization assignment produced the following error message in some contexts:<br>
<code>
** Error: Variable declaration assignments are only allowed at
          the module level or if the variables are automatic.
</code>
<br>
The initial value assignment is now allowed in all scopes.</li>
<li>
The simulator incorrectly handled 2-state variables when generating VCD files. In
some cases the VCD output contained 'X' and 'Z' values.</li>
<li>
In some conditions, $fullskew violated when simultaneous input events occurred.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog bind to interface generated the error message "object not found" for instance actuals.</li>
<li>
In some cases when bit-stream cast was used to cast a class variable containing a dynamic array, an incorrect error was reported about a size mismatch for the cast.
</li>
<li>
Unless the remain_active_flag is set, $fullskew will now become dormant after a violation is reported or after the timing check is satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
SystemVerilog packed structures and packed multi-dimension arrays are now supported by acc_fetch_range, acc_fetch_value, and acc_set_value in the same manner as equivalent vectors.</li>
<li>
The acc_fetch_size routine returned incorrect results or crashed for some types of SystemVerilog objects.</li>
<li>
The acc_set_value routine now supports SystemVerilog 2-state types (acc_fetch_value had already supported 2-state types).</li>
<li>
The acc_object_of_type routine now returns TRUE for the accVector property for SystemVerilog objects that are packed structures or packed multi-dimension arrays.</li>
<li>
The acc_handle_tfarg routine now returns a handle of type accPartSelect for a part-select of a register type argument. Previously, an accPartSelect handle was returned only for a part-select of vector net, and a NULL handle was returned for a part-select of a vector register.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
A compiler optimization applied to assignment statements with circular references through attribute expressions resulted in the compiler consuming all memory, and issuing a fatal error. The assignments that triggered this fault have the following properties:<br>
<UL>
<LI>The statement is evaluated whenever the enclosing subprogram or process is evaluated.
<LI>There is no other assignment to the statement's target preceding the assignment statement.
<LI>The target of the assignment is a variable.
An example of a circular reference is the following (where foo is a function call):<br>v := foo(v'length);

<li>
Changed the vcom error message text to include the buffer port name in error messages that indicate multiple sources are present with buffer port connections.</li>
<li>
vopt failed on the following construct: for A_VARIABLE in A_TYPE generate.

</li>
<li>
vopt sometimes incorrectly ignored generic maps and set generics to their default values when entities contained generics with implicit subtypes, such as ranges.</li>
<li>
The 'event signal attribute produced a simulator crash for certain partial atomic signals.</li>
<li>
Large VHDL files meeting certain pathological criteria could take an inordinately long time to compile.  The compiler has been made more efficient, resulting in smaller compile times.</li>
<li>
Processing by vopt incorrectly reported bounds errors in instances of design units within indeterminate conditional generates and loop generates. The bounds errors involve expressions containing generics for which constant values are inferred. It is incorrect to report errors, because elaboration-time evaluation of the enclosing generate statements may result in the instances with bounds errors  not being loaded by the simulator. The bounds errors are now reported as warnings.</li>
<li>
If a change was made to a configured architecture, vopt failed to detect the dependence of the configuration on the architecture, and did not regenerate the configuration. As a result, the simulator detected a dependence conflict and issued the following error:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.config because work.ent(arch) has changed.
</code>
<br>
Additional recompiles do not resolve the error.
</li>
<li>
A procedure with an array type out or inout mode signal parameter had sometimes caused a crash because of two conflicting optimizations.</li>
<li>
Designs using configurations could have seen load errors during refresh or vopt optimization. The design units that had errors had compiled correctly with the <b>-novitalcheck</b> option, but the configuration was not compiled with this option.  The incorrect setting of options while loading dependencies was the root cause of this error.</li>
<li>
In mixed language designs, vopt incorrectly skipped processing instantiations that followed a conditional generate whose condition evaluated to FALSE when the condition involved generics with values that had been inferred to be constants.</li>
<li>
vopt crashed if the condition expression in an if statement was an inline function call.</li>
<li>
If an undeclared identifier was used in a slice, the compiler crashed instead
of reporting the identifier as being undefined. </li>
<li>
If an assert within a block statement referenced, direct or indirect, the signal
attributes 'EVENT or 'LAST_EVENT the simulator crashed in some cases.</li>
<li>
Under some conditions, the attributes 'EVENT and 'LAST_EVENT were not correctly computed for array signals.</li>

<li>
Optimization (vopt) of a design having large Verilog hierarchies instantiated underneath VHDL consumed excessive memory and time in some cases.</li>

<li>
Verilog packages and interfaces are no longer visible to VHDL design units.

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
Due to customer requests, statement coverage has been added for
VHDL concurrent conditional signal assignments and selected signal
assignments.</li>
<li>
The User Interface was modified to suppress the display of implicit wires in the Structure and Process windows. The debugger will not step into implicit wire processes when the display of implicit wires is suppressed. This behavior is controlled by a preference variable, PrefMain(HideImplicitWires). When this variable is set to 0 (zero) it displays implicit wires and allows the debugger to step into them and when it is set to 1 (the default), it hides them and suppresses debugger interaction with them.</li>
<li>
Breakpoint and Fatal error messages have changed.  They now display the name of the function, task, subprogram, module, or architecture where the condition occurred, in addition to the file and line number.  This additional information should make it easier to debug.  This old message format can be enabled for backward compatibility by modifying the modelsim.ini variable ShowFunctions. Setting this to 0 will revert the messages to the previous format.</li>
<li>
The <b>see</b> command has been enhanced.  It will now accept 1 or 2 arguments.  These arguments are the number of source file lines to display before and after the current execution line.  The <b>see</b> command has also been made available in GUI mode in addition to command line mode.<br>
<code>
    see    ;# Display source file lines around the current execution line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;# By default 5 lines before and 4 lines after are displayed<br>

    see &lt;n&gt;  ;# Display &lt;n&gt; lines before and after the current line.
<br>
    see &lt;pre&gt; &lt;post&gt; ;# Display &lt;pre&gt; line before and &lt;post&gt; lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;# after the current line<br>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.2b</b>
<ul>
<li>
$root as the prefix for a hierarchical name is now supported.
</li>
<li>
DPI import and export tfs are supported in generate loop scopes.</li>
<li>
Cdebug support for conditional C breakpoint is added. To specify the condition expression of a C breakpoint, use the <b>bp</b> command and switch <b>-cond &lt;cond-expression&gt;</b>. For example:
<br>
<code>
    bp -c -cond "x < 5" foo.c 10
</code>
<br>
The breakpoint query command <b>bp</b> will report the current condition expression if there is one. In the same example as above, <b>bp</b> reports:
<br>
<code>
    Id c.1 File foo.c line 10 Status Enabled Cond {stop only if x<5}
</code>
</li>
<li>
The new command <b>wave configcursor</b> has been added to get or set the name, time or lock state of a wave cursor.  Additionally, the <b>-name</b> and <b>-lock</b> switches were added to the "wave addcursor" to allow setting of these configurations at the time the cursor is added.</li>
<li>
The constraint solver now includes an optimization for '==' constraints. 
For constraints like "x == y % z;", where there are no other constraints on 'x' this can yield a significant performance increase. Note: this may change the random sequences produced, compared to the previous release. (see <b>vsim -solverev</b>).</li>
<li>
vsim now has an option to specify random sequence compatibility with a previous letter release. Use the <b>-solverev</b> command line option or "SolveRev" in the modelsim.ini file.</li>
<li>
SystemC DPI users can now register SystemC member import function for multiple SystemC module instances using the same global function name. Two built-in SystemVerilog functions are provided to control the calling scope of SystemC on runtime:
<br>
<code>
  function string scSetScopeByName(input string sc_scope_name);
</code>
<br>
<code>
  function string scGetScopeName();
</code>
<br>
Please refer to the latest User Guide, Section "SystemC Procedural Interface to SystemVerilog" in Chapter "SystemC Simulation", for more details.
 </li>
<li>
The <b>vcover merge -du &lt;du_fullname&gt;</b> option has been implemented 
under UCDB, where &lt;du_fullname&gt; is of the form library.primary(secondary), 
where library can be left out if it is "work", and secondary can be left 
out if it is Verilog. This option merges all instances of the specified design
unit in all the input files, and creates an output file consisting of one 
instance of the design unit, containing all the merged data. The instance name
of the output is the name of the first instance encountered in the input files.</li>
<li>
sccom accepts the <b>-nodebug</b> switch which disables creation of the debug database for modules defined in those source files. With <b>-nodebug</b>, sccom does not run the sparse compiler which creates the debug database. All files containing the SC_MODULE_EXPORT() macro call must be compiled without the <b>-nodebug</b> switch otherwise the design will not load.  Using this option reduces the compile time for a design significantly and may be useful for users running designs in regression mode who are not trying to debug a design. It is also helpful for users trying to create a library(.a) from the object files (.o) created by sccom that they will link later with the SystemC shared object.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage exclude</b> command is supported in viewcov mode for all coverage types except toggles.</li>
<li>
A new Call Stack view is available.  This window will display the current call stack when single stepping or when a breakpoint is hit.  A Double-Click on a stack entry will cause the Locals window to display the local variables at that level and the corresponding source code will be displayed in the Source window. To open this window, select menu View->Call Stack.<br>
Currently this window must be opened manually with each new invocation of ModelSim, as the layout information is not saved.  This is done for backward compatibility with prior 6.2 and earlier releases.  This problem will be fixed in release 6.3.
</li>
<li>
JobSpy now accepts the <b>force</b> command to force signal values in a remote simulation.</li>
<li>
Added two functions to the FLI to format time values into strings in order
to provide formatting equivalent to the display in the vsim GUI. The new
functions are mti_NowFormatted(), which returns the current simulation time
formatted according to specified flags, and mti_TimeToString(), which 
supplies a time argument instead of using the current simulation time.
See the mti.h file for arguments and flag definitions.</li>
