   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 5.8
       release.
          + For Linux:
               o Linux  is  built  on  RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1.
                 This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher.
               o RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release
                 with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60.
               o RedHat 9.0 is now supported (32-bit only).
               o We  will  soon  validate  32-bit ModelSim on the Opteron
                 platform  (in  32-bit  mode  only).  The  first OS to be
                 supported  is  SuSE SLES 9. It is not recommended to run
                 32-bit  ModelSim  on versions of SuSE earlier then 9. At
                 the time of writting this release note, ModelSim has not
                 been validated on SuSE 9 although this validation should
                 be complete in a week or two.
               o Linux now supports large files.
          + For AIX:
               o rs64  is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1
                 and higher OS versions.
               o rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
               o rs64  will  support  large  files if you are using a JFS
                 type file system and the large file option is enabled.
               o AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8  Betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating  your  Libraries"  in  the  ModelSim  Installation &
       Licensing Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the 5.8 release. If you are migrating to the 5.8 release from 5.7x
       or  earlier  releases,  please  also  consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and
       restart  it  using  the  vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this
       release.  If  you  use  nodelocked  licenses  you don't need to do
       anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that do have a .Z extension.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom]section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatability information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects,  'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used,not
            'gcc'.  This combination work on both AIX-4.3 and AIX-5.1. On
            AIX-5.1,  either of the gcc-3.2 compilers can be used (either
            gcc-3.2-aix43  or gcc-3.2-aix51). The native compiler /bin/cc
            is not compatable with gdb-6.0.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * The coverage reload command was missing the -root and -incremental
       options in the GUI.
     * The Source window examine and describe operations could not handle
       aliases and array elements.
     * Verilog  named  events  were  not  displayed correctly in the List
       window.
     * Projects  now have a mechanism for adding miscellaneous options to
       compiles.
     * The  user could not break when a .wlf file was loading if the file
       was opened with the Open Dataset dialog.
     * Environment  variable  references for project files were not saved
       in the ".mpf" file.
     * Coverage report filters did not work in the case of reporting on a
       specific instance or a source file.
     * For rs6000 and rs64 only, the Tcl Stubs interface must be used for
       building and loading shared libraries in Tcl. The Init function in
       the shared library must call Tcl_InitStubs() like this:
    if (Tcl_InitStubs(interp, TCL_VERSION, 1) == NULL) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
       The  shared  library must be linked with the tclstub archive using
       these switches:
    -L/modeltech/rs6000 -ltclstub8.3
       Other platforms may optionally use the preferred Stubs method.
     * The  -sdfmaxerrors  option  was  ignored when used at the ModelSim
       prompt and could cause a crash if "-sdfmaxerrors 1" was specified.
     * When  the  PrefMain(LinePrefix)  option was set to an empty string
       (""), output to the transcript was sometimes chopped off.
     * The File menu in the Wave window has been changed by removing Open
       Dataset,  Load  Format,  Save Dataset, Save Format, and Save Image
       and adding the following instead:
       File > Open > Dataset
       File > Open > Format
       File > Save > Dataset
       File > Save > Format
       File > Save > Image
     * After  executing the quit -sim command, the report simulator state
       command  reported  "now" and "delta" to be their values at the end
       of simulation. When not simulating, these values are now both 0.
     * Waveform  selection  highlighting  on Windows platforms caused the
       selected waveform to be drawn as a solid grey bar.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * Verilog generate statements are now supported in -fast mode.
     * Verilog  path pulse violation messages were changed to report port
       name rather than net name.
     * Ordered  parameter  instantiations  now  ignore localparams in the
       instantiated module.
     * When  compiling a Verilog file with the -fast or +opt switch, VHDL
       configurations   could   not   be   referenced  by  Verilog.  This
       restriction is now removed.
     * Assigning a floating point value to an element of an array of time
       caused upper-level bits to get lost (set to zero).
     * A  hierarchical path that includes a generate block indexed with a
       variable  is  illegal.  The  compiler now returns an error in this
       case.
     * Timing  checks  with  zero-width  violation  regions  and negative
       limits were ignored in delay net delay solution calculations.
     * Hierarchical  references  to  the  ports  of optimized cells could
       cause them to not be optimized.
     * The  X and Z fill was incorrectly occurring for some sized literal
       constants when assigned to a larger sized variable or net.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * Verilog generate instances were not accessible through the PLI.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * In  some  contexts,  a vcom compilation error was generated when a
       user  comment line of the form "-- coverage" was confused with the
       pragmas "-- coverage on" and "-- coverage off".
     * vcom  previously  allowed  a  generate  statement  without a BEGIN
       keyword   between   the   declarative  items  and  the  concurrent
       statements.   Now   a  warning  message  is  issued,  or,  if  the
       -pedanticerrors  option  is used, an error message is given, since
       this is technically illegal VHDL.
     * Declaring  a  very  large  array  within  a  subprogram on Windows
       platforms  in some cases caused a crash. The available stack space
       was increased.
     * In  some  cases  if a package was compiled with optimization level
       -O0 or -O1 and the design unit using the package was compiled with
       -O4  or  -O5,  an  incorrect simulation resulted. The problem also
       occurred if the package was compiled with -O4 or -O5 and the using
       design  unit  was  compiled with -O1 or -O0. For this to occur the
       package  had  to  define  constants  that  were  initialized  with
       expressions  that  used &, or any function from std_logic_arith or
       numeric_std,   and  contained  a  vector  as  the  result  of  the
       expression or subexpression.
     * In  previous  releases  ModelSim failed to check that a resolution
       function  was  not  included  in  a  declaration when declaring an
       access type.
     * Syntax error messages generated by vcom no longer convert the text
       found  "near"  the error to lowercase; the text is displayed as it
       is found in the source file.
     * The `path_name attribute returned the wrong value if used within a
       clocked  process  and  other clocked processes with the same clock
       and  reset  existed  in other instances in the design. The correct
       path_name is now returned.
     * The  VHDL compiler reported size errors within generate statements
       at  compile  time  even  if  the  condition was locally static and
       FALSE.  This  prevented  valid  designs from compiling. In 5.8 the
       compiler  now  checks  the  generate  condition.  If  the generate
       condition is false, then no error or warning is reported if a size
       mismatch  is  found.  If the condition is locally static and true,
       and  a  size  mismatch is found, then an error is reported. If the
       condition  is  not  locally  static, a warning is issued if a size
       mismatch is found.
     * In  some cases, an optimized VHDL array signal set to a value with
       the FLI function mti_SetSignalValue() did not correctly log to the
       WLF file the next transition on the array.
     * Lengths  of  non-static  array  elements  of  aggregates  were not
       compared with the declared type's array lengths. A simulator error
       message is now issued in the event of a mismatch.
     * Under -O5 optimization, assignments to the first field of a record
       in  some  case  were  erroneously  hoisted  out  of a loop despite
       dependence on values computed in the loop.
     * If  a  qualified  expression q'(e) was used in a context where the
       type  of e was illegal, the compiler did not identify the error if
       q was unconstrained. For example, if v was declared as string(1 to
       3), the assignment
       v := string'("00");
       did  not  produce  an error report. Type checking was strengthened
       for  qualified expressions, ensuring that a qualified expression's
       type is not more general than its contained expression.
     * The  VHDL  compiler  incorrectly  diagnosed a mismatch between the
       declaration of a subprogram in a package header and its definition
       in  the  package  body  when  parameters  to  the  subprogram  had
       non-static constrained types, even though the types were lexically
       identical.
     * Some  non-static  slices  of  arrays of arrays failed when used as
       targets in signal assignments.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.8
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.8
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * A   VITAL   model  driving  a  Verilog  module  using  multisource
       interconnects  annotated  incorrectly  if  the  SDF  file  used an
       uppercase module name for the VITAL cell.
     * In   some  cases  the  wrong  driver  was  found  when  annotating
       multisource interconnects from Verilog cells to VITAL cells.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8
     * In  rare  cases  the  simulator  crashed,  while  stepping over or
       breaking  at  certain  lines  of code, or incorrectly reported the
       current line number.
     * Versions  of  hp700  ModelSim newer than 5.5f crashed at load time
       with  a  SIGILL. The SIGILL occurred on HP B180 9000/778 computers
       running HPUX 11.X.
     * In   rare   cases,  single-stepping  produced  the  error  "Cannot
       disassemble opcode!".
     * In  some  cases  vcd2wlf  crashed when similar VCD IDs were shared
       between variables of differing types (i.e., wire and reg).
     * VCD  files  generated  from  "vcd  dumpports"  or  $dumpports were
       limited to a maximum of 10,000 ports. That limit has been removed.
     * wlf2log  did not run fast enough in some cases. The performance is
       now substantially improved.
     * vcd2wlf  could  crash  with non-MTI generated VCD files containing
       same VCD IDs of differing types.
     * A  problem  was  introduced in 5.7e with extended identifier names
       that  look  like  arrays.  There  was  also  a problem with escape
       characters  in  names which caused redundent backslash characters.
       For  example,  the  following  expression  "\\\foo[0][0]\"  is now
       corrected to be "\foo[0][0]\".
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.8
     * DR  00128501 - Out-of-range messages involving real data-types are
       now reported with greater precision. This avoids the rounding that
       could  result  in  confusing messages, such as "Value -1 is out of
       range -1 to 1."
     * DR   00146869   -   The  PROCEDURE  modelsim_lib.util.signal_force
       sometimes  failed  or  crashed  when  called multiple times with a
       string literal actual for the 2nd argument (formal "force_value").
     * DR  00150322  -  In  the  Wave  window,  when  you enable Waveform
       Selection  Highlighting  Enabled(In Tools-Window Preferences), the
       waveforms are never highlighted.
       The  issue  was  that  waveform  selection highlighting on Windows
       platforms caused the selected waveform to be drawn as a solid grey
       bar.
     * ER   00127368   -   Add  support  to  ModelSim  for  Verilog  2001
       configurations.
     * DR  00120581  -  Sub-program  array  allocation causes ModelSim to
       crash.
     * DR  00108141  -  Simulation  performance  slowness  in interactive
       session.
     * DR 00105824 / SC338893 - Optimized Verilog assignments are missing
       the "arrow" when viewing the source.
     * ER  00104707  /  SC337651  -  New option at compilation to get LRM
       paragraph in case of error.
     * ER  00100947  - Would like ModelSim to be able to view .zip source
       files.
     * ER 00094891 / SC306091 - Would like Lmtools added to ModelSim.
     * ER 00094808 - Would like switch to show missing ports.
     * ER 00084019 - Wave Window performance is incredibly slow.
     * DR 00106821 - misleading message: (All branch statements covered).
     * ER  00064559  /  SC160875 - Change command should work predictably
       with generics.
     * DR 00152560 - Wrong simulation behavior of fifo.
     * DR  00152522  -  nolog  switches  -in, -out, -inout, -internal and
       -ports; # Unrecognized switch.
     * DR  00108141  -  Simulation  performance  slowness  in interactive
       session.
     * DR 00105105 - Instance Coverage window not linked to Source window
       correctly.
     * ER 00112410 - Cross-highlight a signal in all windows.
     * ER  00121310  -  No  warning when using vlog option in compilation
       commands.
     * DR 00142374 - Crash related to VPI.
     * DR  00150004  - A function name exists both in modelsim kernel and
       FLI   application.   In   one   case,   the   function   name  was
       "drive_signal".  As a workaround, the user can change the function
       name in the FLI application.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 5.8
     * During  code  coverage  on packages, each package needs to be in a
       separate  file and not be mixed with entities or architectures, or
       the statistics will be merged together.
     * In  the  RedHat 9.0 environment, when a Dataflow window is opened,
       vish may hang. The work-around is to set the following environment
       variable prior to invoking the vsim session.
       C-Shell Syntax
       setenv LD_ASSUME_KERNEL 2.4.1
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 5.8
     * Changed the limitation that allows running only one instance of PE
       on  a  machine  with a node-locked license so that one instance of
       any OEM can be run on the same machine where one instance of PE is
       running.
     * The  change  command  was  rewritten  so that it now allows you to
       change  more  objects than was previously possible. See the change
       command  documentation  in  the  ModelSim  Command  Reference  for
       details.
     * The  quit  -sim  command now causes the simulation kernel to exit,
       leaving  the  user  interface  running.  The  FLI quit callback is
       called when the kernel exits. In previous versions of ModelSim the
       restart  callback  was  called  for  quit -sim. In cases where the
       -keeploaded  command  line  argument  is used, the kernel does not
       exit  and  quit  -sim results in a restart callback as before. The
       restart  command does not cause the kernel to exit, so the restart
       callback is called as before. If a simulation is loaded after quit
       -sim, then mti_IsFirstInit() returns true.
     * The gdb debugger is now distributed with ModelSim. This eliminates
       the need for users to track compatability between gdb versions and
       ModelSim's  CDEBUG feature. As a result, the CDEBUG Setup dialogue
       now has a "default" selection for the path to gdb. Users can still
       use custom versions of gdb at their own discretion by choosing the
       "custom" selection.
     * ModelSim  now  automatically  launches the gdb debugger when users
       issue  debug  commands  on C/C++ source files. If you try to set a
       breakpoint  while  viewing  a C/C++ source file, or if you issue a
       "gdb"  command  at  the  VSIM>  prompt,  gdb will be automatically
       launched (if it is not already running).
     * The  "Start  Here  for  ModelSim" manual has been renamed. The new
       title is "ModelSim Installation & Licensing."
     * ModelSim  will now report the name of unconnected ports as part of
       the "Too few port connections." [TFMPC] warning.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8
     * A  change  was made in the Dataflow window to be able to show VHDL
       record elements instead of showing the entire record.
     * Two  new features were added to the Dataflow window to expand nets
       to:
       - Primary design inputs
       - Primary hierarchical inputs
     * The  new  commands  setenv  and  unsetenv  have  been added. These
       commands  will add, modify, or remove environment variables in the
       context of the simulator and user interface. They are used to keep
       these two ModelSim processes synchronized.
     * Code  Coverage  was  enhanced in 5.8 to include condition coverage
       and expression coverage. Please see the User's Manual for details.
       Also,  coverage  was changed so that only statement coverage is on
       by  default.  Branch,  condition,  and expression coverage require
       compile  time  options of the form -cover bcetx where "b" turns on
       branch,  "c"  turns  on  condition,  and  "e"  turns on expression
       coverage  for  the design units being compiled. "t" and "x", which
       are  mutually  exvlusive,  turn  on  toggle  and  extended  toggle
       coverage  respectively  for  all  signals  in  the compiled design
       units. Coverage reports now include source code with the metrics.
     * Toggle coverage for 5.8 was enhanced to include Verilog registers,
       and now has an extended mode that includes transitions to and from
       Z  or  X. The extended mode is invoked using the -full option with
       the  toggle  add  command.  Toggle  coverage  can  be turned on at
       compile  time  using  -cover  t  or  -cover x. "t" turns on 2-edge
       toggle coverage and "x" turns on 6-edge extended coverage.
     * A  new  code coverage merge utility, vcover merge, has been added,
       that merges sets of coverage data without requiring elaboration of
       the  design  and  without  requiring  a simulation license. vcover
       stats  prints  summary  coverage  data  on files and print summary
       information  after each file in a group is merged. The save/reload
       file  now  includes  toggle data and exclusion information. Please
       see the ModelSim Command Reference for details on using vcover.
     * Virtual  Types  now  support  don't-cares.  There  are two ways to
       specify  them:  either  using the '-' character in a binary or hex
       notation value, or by giving a separate mask value. For example:
       virtual type {{0x01-- add}{0x02-- sub}{default bad}} mydecodetype
       virtual  type  {{0x0100  0xff  add}{0x0200 0xff sub}{default bad}}
       mydecodetype
       In  the second example, the middle field is the mask, and the mask
       should  have  bits  set  to  1  for  the bits that are don't care.
       Virtual types support up to 64 bits of value and mask.
     * A  new  Memory  window  has  been introduced in ModelSim 5.8. This
       window  has  the  ability to view arrays of signals and variables.
       Besides  viewing, the ability to search, modify, save to file, and
       restore  from  file  are  also  supported.  The  Memory  window is
       available  in  the  GUI under the View->Memory menu selection. For
       batch  support  of  memories,  there  is a new mem command. Please
       consult the User's Manual for further details.
     * ModelSim 5.8 includes support for Verilog 2001 automatic tasks and
       functions.
     * Functions  which  meet  the requirements of a constant function in
       the Verilog 2001 LRM may now be used in constant expressions.
     * VHDL2002 features:
         1. The compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
            to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
               o select the appropriate version from the compiler options
                 menu in the GUI,
               o invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
               o set   the   VHDL93  variable  in  the  [vcom]section  of
                 modelsim.ini.
                 Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
                    # 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
                    # 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
                    # 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
         2. Buffer  ports may now be associated with ports of mode OUT or
            INOUT. They may also have more than one source. See IEEE VHDL
            Language  Reference  Manual  1076-2002  Section  1.1.1.2  for
            details.
         3. Section  5.2.2  of  the  IEEE  VHDL Language Reference Manual
            VHDL-2002  clarifies  the  rules for finding entity names for
            default  binding. The rules that ModelSim has always used are
            an  extension  of  the  rules  described  in  the  IEEE  LRM.
            ModelSim's  search  rules  are  described in "Default binding
            rules  for  VHDL  resource  libraries"  in  Chapter  3 of the
            ModelSim  User's  Manual.  Starting  with  this  release,  if
            ModelSim  uses rules beyond those given in the IEEE LRM, then
            a  warning  message  is  issued,  or,  if the -pedanticerrors
            compiler option is selected, an error is reported.
         4. Protected types are recognized but not implemented.
       Differences between VHDL-87, VHDL-93, and VHDL-2002:
       Since  the default VHDL language version for vcom has changed from
       VHDL-87  to VHDL-2002, some programs will no longer compile unless
       either  the source code is updated to be compatible with VHDL-2002
       or VHDL-1993, or the language version is reset to VHDL-87.
       Here   are   some   things   to  look  for  to  identify  language
       incompatibilities;
         1. The  only  major problem between VHDL-93 and VHDL-2002 is the
            addition  of  the keyword "PROTECTED". VHDL-93 programs which
            use this as an identifier should choose a different name.
            All other incompatibilities are between VHDL-87 and VHDL-93.
         2. VITAL and SDF:
            It  is  important  to  use  the  correct language version for
            VITAL.  VITAL2000 must be compiled with VHDL-93 or VHDL-2002.
            VITAL95  must  be  compiled  with  VHDL-87.  A  typical error
            message  which  indicates  the need to compile under language
            version VHDL-87 is:
            "VITALPathDelay   DefaultDelay   parameter  must  be  locally
            static"
         3. Purity of NOW:
            In  VHDL-93  the  function "now" is impure. Consequently, any
            function  which  invokes  "now"  must  also be declared to be
            impure.  Such  calls  to  "now" occur in VITAL. Typical error
            message:
            "Cannot  call impure function 'now' from inside pure function
            '<name>'"
         4. Files:
            File  syntax  and  usage  have  changed  between  VHDL-87 and
            VHDL-93. In many cases vcom issues a warning and continues:
            "Using 1076-1987 syntax for file declaration."
            In  addition,  when  files  are  passed  as  parameters,  the
            following warning message is produced:
            "Subprogram  parameter  name  is  declared  using  VHDL  1987
            syntax."
            This  message  often  involves calls to endfile(<name>) where
            <name> is a file parameter.
         5. Files and packages:
            Each package header and body should be compiled with the same
            language  version. Common problems in this area involve files
            as parameters and the size of type CHARACTER. For example, if
            a  package  header and body have a procedure which has a file
            parameter, such as:
            procedure proc1 ( out_file : out std.textio.text) ...
            If  you  compile the package header with VHDL-87 and the body
            with VHDL-93 or VHDL-2002, you will get an error message such
            as:
            "**  Error:  mixed_package_b.vhd(4):  Parameter  kinds do not
            conform  between  declarations  in  package  header and body:
            'out_file'."
         6. Direction of concatenation:
            To solve some technical problems, the rules for direction and
            bounds of concatenation were changed from VHDL-87 to VHDL-93.
            You  won't  see  any  difference  in  simple  variable/signal
            assignments such as:
            v1 := a & b;
            But  if  you (1) have a function which takes an unconstrained
            array  as a parameter, (2) pass a concatenation expression as
            a  formal  argument to this parameter and (3) the body of the
            function  makes  assumptions about the direction or bounds of
            the parameter, then you will get unexpected results. This may
            be  a  problem  in  environments which assume that all arrays
            have "downto" direction.
         7. xnor:
            "xnor"  is a reserved word in VHDL-93. If you declare an xnor
            function  in  VHDL-87  (without  quotes) and compile it under
            VHDL-2002 you will get an error message like the following:
            **   Error:   xnor.vhd(3):  near  "xnor":  expecting:  STRING
            IDENTIFIER
         8. 'FOREIGN attribute
            In  VHDL-93, package STANDARD declares an attribute 'FOREIGN.
            If  you  declare your own attribute with that name in another
            package,  then  we  issue  a  warning  message  such  as  the
            following:
            -- Compiling package foopack
            **  Warning:  foreign.vhd(9):  (vcom-1140)  VHDL-1993 added a
            definition  of the attribute foreign to package std.standard.
            The  attribute  is  also defined in package 'standard'. Using
            the definition from package 'standard'.
         9. Size of CHARACTER type:
            In  VHDL-87  type CHARACTER has 128 values, in VHDL-93 it has
            256  values.  Code  which  depends  on  this size will behave
            incorrectly. This is most likely to occur in test suites that
            check VHDL functionality. It's unlikely to occur in practical
            designs.  A  typical  instance  is the replacement of warning
            message:
            "range nul downto del is null"
            by
            "range  nul  downto  'ÿ'  is  null"  --  range  is nul downto
            y(umlaut)
        10. bit string literals:
            In  VHDL-87  bit  string  literals are of type bit_vector. In
            VHDL-93  they can also be of type STRING or STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.
            This  implies  that  some expressions that are unambiguous in
            VHDL-87  now  become  ambiguous  is  VHDL-93. A typical error
            message is:
            **   Error:   bit_string_literal.vhd(5):  Subprogram  '='  is
            ambiguous.    Suitable    definitions   exist   in   packages
            'std_logic_1164' and 'standard'.
        11. In VHDL-87 when using individual subelement association in an
            association  list,  associating  individual  subelements with
            NULL   is   discouraged.   In  VHDL-93  such  association  is
            forbidden. A typical message is:
            "Formal  '<name>'  must  not  be  associated  with  OPEN when
            subelements are associated individually."
     * ModelSim  5.8 supports SystemC as a native simulator language. The
       sccom  command  is  used  to compile SystemC files into the design
       library.  Verilog  and  VHDL  design units can instantiate SystemC
       design  units, and SystemC design units can instantiate Verilog or
       VHDL  design  units. The GUI tools such as the Structure, Signals,
       and  Wave windows all support SystemC objects in a native fashion.
       Please refer to the User's Guide for more details.
     * The  describe  command  now  supports instance names. This command
       will   provide  design  unit  information  including  source  file
       pathname(s) for instances.
     * Project  compile  status now indicates whether a succesful compile
       has  warnings  or  not.  The  warning  status  is  displayed  as a
       different icon.
     * When  suspending  ModelSim  with  "^Z"  in  the parent shell or by
       sending  a  SIGTSTP  signal  to the vish process or to the process
       group for vish/vsimk, all the checked out licenses will be checked
       in.  When  "unsuspending"  or continuing ModelSim by using "bg" or
       "fg"  in  the  parent  shell or by sending a SIGCONT signal to the
       vish process or to the process group for vish/vsimk, ModelSim will
       attempt to re-aquire the licenses needed to resume.
       In  order  to  keep  the  licenses  from  being  checked  in  when
       suspending   ModelSim,  you  must  set  the  environment  variable
       RELEASE_ON_SUSPEND  to  0.  If this environment variable is unset,
       the  default  behavior  is  to  check in licenses when ModelSim is
       suspended.
       It's recommended that all signals only be sent to the vish process
       or  the  vish/vsimk  process  group. Never send signals to the vlm
       process.
     * Users  can  now  add files directly to Project folders by dragging
       the  files  onto a folder and releasing. When the cursor is over a
       project  folder,  the folder will highlight, which indicates it is
       the drop point. (Windows version only).
     * A  new  dialog  called  "Project Settings" is now available in the
       Project window. This dialog allows users to specify global project
       settings.  Currently  the  dialog  allows  users  to  specify  the
       double-click  behavior  for  each  file  type,  how compile output
       should be handled, and whether location maps are used.
     * Support of compressed files (GNU zip format - .gz) in ModelSim 5.8
       is as follows:
          + VCD  - Supports writing and reading of compressed files. When
            specifying  VCD  file names for writing via ModelSim commands
            or Verilog system tasks, names that end in .gz will result in
            the creation of a compressed file. ModelSim VCD commands also
            have  a -compress switch which creates a compressed file with
            a  .gz  extension.  When  reading compressed VCD files, a .gz
            extension is not required.
          + SDF - Supports reading of compressed files. The .gz extension
            is not required.
          + Checkpoint/Restore   -   Supports   writing  and  reading  of
            compressed  files.  The compression of the checkpoint file is
            controlled  solely  by the CheckpointCompressMode variable in
            the modelsim.ini file. The .gz extension is not appended when
            writing and not required when reading.
          + Elab/Load_Elab  -  Supports writing and reading of compressed
            files.  The  creation  of  a  compressed  elaboration file is
            controlled  by  the  -compress_elab vsim command line switch.
            The  .gz  extension  is  not  appended  when  writing and not
            required when reading.
          + vcom/vlog  -  Supports  reading  of compressed files. The .gz
            extension is not required.
          + Source  window  -  can  view  and  edit compressed files, but
            cannot create a new compressed file. The .gz extension is not
            required.
     * SuSE Linux support notes:
       ModelSim  5.8  does  not  officially  support  SuSE Linux, but the
       software  has  been  cursorily  tested  and  validated on SuSE 8.2
       Professional. If you are running on SuSE 8.2 and you would like to
       try  ModelSim  5.8, please make sure that you have the "statd" RPM
       installed  and  operational.  You  must  have the rpc.statd daemon
       running, which doesn't appear to be the SuSE default. Also, please
       make sure you install the "termcap-developer" RPM.
     * Code  coverage  now  supports  instance-specific exclusions. These
       exclusions  can  be specified in an exclusion file or via the GUI,
       are  saved and reloaded with the coverage save and coverage reload
       commands,  and can be merged using the vcover merge utility or the
       coverage reload command.
     * WLF   file   optimization   provides   substantial   wave  drawing
       performance  improvement  at  large zoom levels. The optimizations
       are enabled by default. They can be disabled using the vsim option
       -wlfnoopt.
