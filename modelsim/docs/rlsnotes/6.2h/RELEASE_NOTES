   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * Coverage filenames that contained a hyphen ('-') character could not be
       successfully read using the vsim -viewcov <filename> command.
     * On Windows, invoking the File->Save As... menu pick from an undocked
       Transcript window caused the Main window to be activiated. Now, the
       Transcript window stays on top.
     * The Dataflow window did not use the namespace portion of object names
       passed to it.
     * Wave window Find Previous Transition and Find Next Transition searches,
       for searches that required a relatively long time to perform, could
       crash the front end when another search was attempted while a search was
       ongoing. Such searches are now ignored when a search is underway. Search
       attempts are also ignored when the active cursor is locked (including
       the Now cursor).
     * A delayed virtual signal could not be logged or added as a trigger to
       the List window.
     * Expanding a ref struct variable did not expand its value in the Locals
       window.
     * In a SystemVerilog design, the connection between a logic variable and
       an  input  or output logic port was not displayed correctly in the
       Dataflow window. For example, in the simple design below, the connection
       between /top/A and /top/m/B failed to display properly:
       module top(); var logic A; assign A=1; mid m(A); endmodule
       module mid(input logic B); wire x=B; endmodule
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * A default skew containing both edge and time delay values would cause a
       crash if the clocking block contained no signals.
     * The -vlog95compat switch no longer allows comma separated event lists.
     * In  some  cases,  initializing  a static variable inside a task in
       SystemVerilog code caused the compiler to generate an internal error
       message. An example is when the initial value was a time literal such as
       "0ns".
     * An if-statement branch within an always block failed to execute in some
       cases when optimized in conjunction with a similar always block having a
       similar if-statement having an empty begin-end block in one of its
       branches.
     * Error messages associated with objects located in $unit would report the
       incorrect file name.
     * When compiling SystemVerilog source with the -incr option the compiler
       was not recompiling modules when imported packages were modified.
     * Event control expressions containing logical operators such as "@(a &&
       b)" or "@(a || b)" caused an internal compiler error when used inside an
       automatic task.
     * When using the vopt +acc option on SystemVerilog packages, the generated
       code  sometimes  did  not permit breakpoints on calls to tasks and
       functions in the package.
     * Bidirectional pass switches had not been included in creating extended
       VCD files.
     * The ternary operator produced incorrect results in some cases if the
       condition operand was a bitwise inversion of a vector result.
     * An  indexed  part-select of a vector net in a port connection list
       resulted in an inappropriate error message indicating that the "bounds
       are reversed" in an optimized design where the connected module was
       inlined.
     * The  sensitivity  list  implied for @* failed to include variables
       referenced in unreachable statements or ineffectual expressions due to
       constant propagation optimizations.
     * There was a problem where concatenation of duplicate 2-state values
       could produce the wrong result. For example:
       {bval[63:0],bval[63:0]}
     * Conditional pathdelay selection could be incorrect particularly when
       multiple sequential cells are connected to a common clock net.
     * Gate-level models with buffered delayed nets did not function correctly
       with +delayed_timing_checks.
     * The parser would not correctly handle block comments containing "/*" as
       in /*/AUTOWIRE/*/.
     * Signals that are part of an interface instantiated as a vector could not
       be individually logged or added to a Wave window.
     * The simulator crashed in certain cases when using $countdrivers.
     * In  certain  cases where the bounds are non-constant, a continuous
       assignment of a part-select did not trigger properly. For Example:
       parameter porta_addr_size = f_width2addr(porta_width);
       input [porta_addr_size-1:0] addra;
       wire [8:0] porta_row_addr;
       assign porta_row_addr = addra[(porta_addr_size - 1) -: 9];
     * Using an automatic variable in a system function as an argument to
       another system task or function sometimes caused an internal error like:
       Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(67) vl_save_stack_on_wait
     * In SystemVerilog, the liblist clause of an instance in a config is now
       being inherited hierarchically downward to all entities. This resolution
       will take place before using libraries specified in the -L switch.
     * When using "ref" argument passing to tasks and functions where the type
       of the "ref" argument was a type parameter or parameterized class,
       accesses to the formal could be incorrect and cause incorrect results or
       fatal errors.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * The acc_fetch_value and acc_set_value routines failed on System Verilog
       2-state variable types in the accVectorVal format mode.
     * The function acc_handle_path was not able to find net or signal objects
       when the scope was indexed (For example: /u/w/y[5]/sig1). An earlier fix
       for a similar issue was treating the scope name as an escape id due to
       the presence of [].
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * Use of signal_force() in a VHDL design caused the simulator to crash in
       certain cases.
     * When  run  repeatedly on a top-level design unit, if the hierarchy
       contained a VHDL design unit with at least 2 different specializations
       (different  generic values inferred for instantiations of the same
       architecture), vopt generated code for some of the specialized design
       units, and for all design units at higher levels of the design. vopt
       should  have  determined  that  none  of the design units had been
       recompiled, and therefore no code generation was needed.
     * vcom  and vopt crashed when encountering a slice expression in the
       index_specification   of   a  for  generate_statement_label  in  a
       block_specification within a configuration declaration.
     * If a package declaration contained a subprogram declaration and an
       enumeration literal declaration each with the same simple name, a later
       USE  clause (applying to an otherwise unrelated scope) naming that
       declaration caused a compiler error.
     * If a package is compiled with the -work switch, and is loaded from a
       design containing the statement:
       USE work.all;
       optimization of the design may fail to access components defined in the
       package. When this failure occurs, an error message like the following
       may be issued by vopt:
       ** Error: Prefix pack of selected name is not valid.
       where  "pack"  is  the  name  of  the package containing component
       definitions.
     * In a design containing a configuration that contains specifications for
       multiple levels of hierarchy, if architectures below the topmost level
       are  altered and recompiled, vopt may fail to optimize the changed
       architectures, leaving the previous versions in place, and resulting in
       simulation  of  the  wrong architectures. vopt has been changed to
       re-optimize all architectures specified by a changed configuration.
     * A subprogram defined in a package may be inlined incorrectly by the vopt
       optimizer when the caller of the subprogram is a process using the
       package.
     * vsim failed to load the default architecture of an entity that was also
       instantiated with a direct instantiation statement, and where the direct
       instantiation  contained generics that were inferred by vopt to be
       constants.  For example, if the instantiations were similar to the
       following:
       inst_e1 : entity work.e(a1) generic map( g => 5 );
       inst_e2 : e;
       vsim would issue the following error:
       **Error: Could not find machine code for 'work.e(a2)'.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.2h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.2h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * vsim  crashed  when  a  transaction  stream  was  created  in  the
       start_of_simulation() callback of the parent module.
     * An input or inout port cannot be forced if the port has values coming
       into it from a higher level. Forcing such an input or inout should
       result in an error. For lower level SystemC, this condition was not
       being caught. Now such a case correctly results in an error.
     * A force on a SystemC signal did not always propagate correctly through
       inputs or IOs to instantiated Verilog or VHDL below.
     * The noforce command on a SystemC signal caused a crash if the signal was
       not being forced.
     * sc_object::name() now behaves consistently in vopt and vsim.
     * The  MinGW  gcc compiler distributed with the product had problems
       creating the SystemC shared library when the machine had a already
       installed MinGW gcc.
     * The simlulator was crashing when control_foreign_signal() was called on
       a VHDL signal only a part of which was read in the VHDL.
     * A sc_signal declared as a void* and created in the constructor using
       new() is now debuggable and can be connected at the mixed-language
       boundary. This is supported only when the signal is of a native C++
       type(int, long, char etc) or a built-in SystemC type(sc_int, sc_bv,
       sc_logic etc).
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.2h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * The compiler, when invoked with the -O5 option on a very large design
       unit, crashed in rare cases.
     * In a mixed VHDL-Verilog design, force -freeze on VHDL signals was not
       included in EVCD output.
     * Signal  Spy  failed  to  handle a 1-bit wide Verilog vector as the
       src_object,  resulting in incorrect updates of the dest_object and
       possibly acc_set_value() errors.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * Unreadable UCDB files were created if the vsim command line had any
       quoted newline characters.
     * Excluded toggle bits were displaying in toggle reports.
     * There was a problem when multiple files are compiled with one invocation
       of vcom, vlog or vopt, if coverage is turned off with a coverage off
       pragma,  and there is no matching coverage on pragma in that file,
       coverage continued to be off at the start of the next file. But if
       multiple file compilation unit semantics are in effect, coverage will
       remain off.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.2h
     * Calls  to the signal_release() VHDL procedure or $signal_release()
       Verilog  system  task  could  leak  memory  if  no  prior  call to
       signal_force()/$signal_force() was made on the specific destination
       object.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.2h
     * dts0100398725 - # ** Error: (vsim-3852) Invalid override of parameter.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.2h
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * 'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task
       calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is
       treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.2h
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.2h
     * Added the -noautoldlibpath option to vsim so that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
       not set internally.
     * Added a feature to code coverage to turn off code coverage within vlog
       modules declared as `celldefine/`endcelldefine, and modules included
       using  -v  and  -y. This is disabled as the default, for backwards
       compatibility.  To  enable  it, set the CoverCells variable in the
       modelsim.ini file to 0. To override this feature for individual Verilog
       source files, there is a vlog -covercells option. There is also a vopt
       -covercells option. And if CoverCells in the modelsim.ini file is set to
       1, and you want to turn it off for individual files, there is a vlog
       -nocovercells option. There is also a vopt -nocovercells option. In
       release 6.3, the default will be to turn off coverage on celldefines.
