<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
	<ul>
	<li>win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
	<li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9, 10
	<li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a waveform name contained "[]" syntax, an attempt to use analog formatting would fail. This has been corrected. </li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command failed to work on System Verilog string variables.</li>
<li>
Memory tab in Workspace does not update the memory list after "restart".</li>
<li>
Windows would jump back to the selected item when a node is expanded (click on the [+] sign) if the tree is sorted in an ascending or descending direction.  This issue can be seen in any tree window.  The issue has been resolved.
</li>
<li>
System Verilog transaction does not expand correctly in the Wave window, this is now fixed. The attribute that gave trouble was a Verilog reg type and expanded with a virtual signal.  All such attributes now work correctly.</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in the WLF logging code that would sometimes lead to the GUI crashing with the message:<br>
<code>
 Bad pointer access... Closing vish. Font treeFont still in cache.
</code>
<br>
The bug was intermittent, but could be worked around by running on a single processor system, or disabling WLF threads with the command line option <b>-wlfnothreads</b>.  </li>
<li>
A virtual signal or function that cast a scalar value to a virtual type produced incorrect results. The scalar value was not used as an index into the virtual type. The value required to index a std_logic type to produce the scalar value was used. A new casting directive has been added for GUI Expressions called cast_enum. The cast_enum directive uses the std_logic type index as the value to index the virtual type.</li>
<li>
A new wave group could not be created using the original name of the renamed wave group.</li>
<li>
The <b>onerror</b> and <b>onbreak</b> commands now warn when used outside a macro. The <b>onerror</b> command failed to report the correct action when it was set to an empty string. The value of OnErrorDefaultAction is used, but was not properly reported with an empty <b>onerror</b> command.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator would not identify the correct library to search when a design unit was instantiated within a generate block, and the library was specified by a nested configuration.</li>
<li>
The transaction engine allowed the user to create an attribute from a Verilog named event.  Since this makes no sense in a transaction attribute, events have been disallowed by the transaction engine.  A warning is issued.</li>
<li>
Performing a <b>write timing</b> command during a <b>+notimingchecks</b> simulation could result in a crash.</li>
<li>
Triggering an event with a hierarchical name within a task would sometimes cause a crash during simulation unless the Verilog code was compiled as System Verilog.</li>
<li>
Fixed a crash during elaboration that would occur if randomize() was invoked as the result of a parameter's initializer. This has been fixed, as randomize() is now correctly recognized as a non-const function.</li>
<li>
An optimized design containing modules with ports declared as "trireg" resulted in an elaboration crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
Bit select on enums was causing vlog to fail with <b>+acc</b> option.
</li>
<li>
INTERCONNECT/PORT delay values targeted for ports with escaped identifiers in compiled SDF files were not annotated. </li>
<li>
Logging an inout port to a gate-level optimized cell could crash the simulation.</li>
<li>
Optimization of designs could incorrectly report a non-optimizable recursive generated instantiation when an arrayed instantiation was conditionally generated.</li>
<li>
An import package in a Verilog module that gets bound to a VHDL target may cause vsim to crash.</li>
<li>
Cells containing very long iopath delays and simulated with <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> could have erroneous timing check violation messages. </li>
<li>
The simulator would sometimes crash during elaboration with expressions like <code>++class_obj.array_field[index]</code> or <code>class_obj.array_field[index]++</code> when used inside a parameterized class.</li>
<li>
vlog gave incorrect error messages when index of port connection had function call arguments as genvar.</li>
<li>
Conditional $setuphold timingcheck on unoptimized cells was broken.
</li>
<li>
The DPI function, svGetScopeFromName() will assume that the scope name passed to it is a full-path to the scope when the function is called from outside a regular DPI call chain.  A regular DPI call chain always originates in SystemVerilog and starts with a C import tf call. A call to scGetScopeFromName() from PLI, VPI, FLI and SystemC is considered as a call outside a regular DPI call chain.</li>

<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator would crash when an optimization was performed on a signal array in a package.</li>
<li>
vsim would crash when a std_logic_vector signal was passed to the only element of a port that was an array of std_logic_vectors.
</li>
<li>
In rare instances, the initialization of a driver for a signal array would incorrectly change the signal array initialization.
</li>
<li>
vsim crashed while executing a clocked process that had been incorrectly optimized.</li>
<li>
vsim would crash in rare instances of an instantiated port vector of length one.

<ul>
<li>
The vlog command line option <b>-genvhdl</b> was not properly handled in some cases when the <b>-sv</b> option was used with it.</li>
<li>
When all the parameters in a Verilog module are such that they can not be
dumped in _primary.vhd (because they are not representable), then instead of
dumping nothing, an empty generic is incorrectly being dumped.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>coverage attribute</b> command truncated strings whenever it encountered the special character '%' when printing in Tcl format.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage attribute</b> command could not accept attribute names and values starting with "-".
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem in which branch coverage data for a Verilog ternary
expression would be reversed because of an optimization that swapped the
operands. Operand swapping is now disabled if branch coverage is on for
the expression.</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem for code coverage in Verilog case statements. An optimization
that folds multiple cases that do the same thing into common code, caused
statement coverage results to be incorrect. This caseFold optimization is now
turned off for a Verilog case statement that has code coverage enabled. </li>
<li>
Fixed a problem with vsim running in vopt mode with inlined modules and
arrays of instances. vsim would output errors such as:<br>
<code>
# Internal Error 2 in createLinearToUnionMapNonMonotonic: incorrect merged map<br>
# Internal error in MergeMultipleMaps: NULL merged map for inlined du (...)
</code></li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
Fixed an issue with the vsim command line options <b>-error</b> and -<b>fatal</b>. In some cases, these options would not change the severity level of some warning messages generated during simulation.</li>
<li>
The 6.3e vsim could not be executed on Windows platforms by some OEM products due to an unresolved symbol named "mti_main".</li>

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
Syntax highlighting may not function properly in the Source window (all the source is shown as plain text). You can fix this problem by editing ~/hte/v2_38/hte.ini (where ~ represents your "HOME" directory) and deleting the line that says:<br>
<code>
languages=cxx tcl verilog vhdl XML PSL
</code></li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Attempting to traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an instance or a scope will result in a crash.</li>
<li>
There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.
</ul></li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
vlog will now print an "unsupported" error message for nested design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3.  This error may be suppressed using the <b>-suppress 2230</b> command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3f</b>
<ul>
<li>
If you use the GUI virtual signal/function command with "-install /", 
the signal will no longer be installed at the real context tree root, in
which case it may be inaccessible, and certainly not observable in the
objects window, but will now be installed in the top context of the first
top-level design unit. </li>
<li>
Nested XML testplan import (importing one testplan from inside another testplan) has been enhanced to support cross-format nesting. Previous issues with nesting an auto-numbered testplan inside an explicit-numbered testplan have been resolved. In particular, the following limitations are lifted:
<ul>
<li>Parameter inheritance now works correctly.</li>
<li>An explicit-numbered child testplan no longer has to be numbered to match the parent section.</li>
<li>Auto-numbered child testplans will now be numbered to match their parent section.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>
XML Testplan Import: The behavior of the "-title" and "-tagprefix" options has been clarified in light of the nested testplan enhancement:
<ul><li>For the top-most testplan, if "-title" is not set, the basename of the input XML file is used.</li>
    <li>For the top-most testplan, if "-tagprefix" is not set, the "-title" value is used.</li>
    <li>For nested testplans, neither option has a default (ie: if not set, they remain unset).</li></ul>
Local (child) tags are only generated if the "-tagprefix" is set for the child testplan in question.
</li>
<li>
HTML Coverage Report: The "Coverage by Linked Item" table (on testplan scope summary page) has been significantly enhanced. The instance column now indicates the enclosing HDL scope for branch, condition, and expression coverage; the string in that column is a link pointing to the detailed coverage information for that item; and a column containing the filename and line number of the coverage item has been added.
</li>
<li>
The HTML coverage report has been enhanced to supress the coverage summary page for scopes which have no coverage (either because the source was not instrumented or was later excluded). In most cases, the scope will remain in the navigation tree but will be grayed-out (and not linked to a coverage summary page). In the design tree, if a scope and all it's children have no coverage, the children are dropped from the tree (testplan scopes are never dropped).
</li>
<li>
There have been some changes to the learn flow. Some performance issues have been addressed, including reducing the information learned during an SDF back-annotation phase.</li>
<li>
File locking for UCDB merge:
<br>
We support a cumulative merge (vcover merge out.ucdb out.ucdb in.ucdb). Such merge requests may occur simultaneously from various platforms in a networking environment. In order to avoid corrupting cumulative coverage results, merges of UCDB files are serialized. "out.ucdb" is only written by a single process at a time. 
<ul>
<li>Creation of lock files whose purpose is to signal by their presence that a UCDB is locked for writing. 
<li>Operations are atomic. When creating the lock file, the process verifies that it does not exist and then creates it, but without allowing another process the opportunity to create it in the meantime. 
<li>The lock is advisory. Processes which intend to modify a UCDB file, by convention, check for locks to coordinate access to that file. The system fails if this convention is ignored. 
<li>There is a back-up file mechanism within vcover <b>merge</b> that, when optioned for, saves a back-up of the merge output before merging and can, when optioned for, automatically restore the back-up in case another process has its lock broken. 
<li>When blocked on a lock: 
<ul>
<li>We print out "Waiting for lock..." messages every so often and let the user explicitly break the lock if they think it safe. 
<li>We produce a message similar to: "User Bilbo on machine Frodo has had the lock for 16 days". 
<li>Retry attempts will occur every 10 seconds. 
<li>Blocked messages will repeat about every 3 minutes.
</ul>
<li>The lock is released after a time-out period: 
<ul>
<li>This cannot inadvertently time-out. 
Cannot be broken if a process is starved simply because others get in first. 
Time-out is only for the case where a single process takes too long. 
<li>The time-out period is user-configurable. 
<li>When a time-out condition occurs, the process timing out will be sent a "kill" signal. 
</ul>
</ul></li>
<li>
The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro body through the macro substitution process.
</li>
<li>
The vsim '-assertfile <file>' switch now only applies to assertion (VHDL/SVA/PSL) messages issued by the tool.  Use the vsim '-errorfile <file>' switch to redirect non-assertion tool messages into the specified file. To retain the tool’s previous behavior, set the environment variable MTI_ASSERTFILE_COMPATIBILITY to any value. This environment variable may eventually be deprecated.

In the modelsim.ini file, all “AssertionFormat” variables have been renamed as “MessageFormat” variables. The MessageFormat variables are valid for both assertion and non-assertion tool messages, as before.  For backward compatibility the AssertionFormat variables will continue to be supported.
</li>
<li>
The <b>restart</b> command will reload the current dataset if the current dataset is not the active simulation ("sim"), in effect acting just like a restart of a simulation.  See the <b>dataset restart</b> command below under "New Features".</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below the product directory.</li>
<li>
The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see <b>vcover report -html</b>).</li>
<li>
Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted.  For example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)" and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.  The conditions under which
name permutation could occur are based on internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly correlated to source descriptions.
</li>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};

Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.

Version 6.3d includes the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.
<br>
<br>
Improvements to the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System include the following:
<br>
Search changes -- Improved search time, multiple keyword support, search ranking icons, results filtering by book or topic, and improved accuracy of results.
<br>
Search and content scopes -- A new “My Search Scope” option lets you define a custom set of books to search.
<br>
Global index improvements -- improved viewing speed and collapse/uncollapse of "like" terms.
<br>
Getting Started movie -- provides an overview of all the features of the InfoHub and Mentor Graphic Documentation System. You can view the Getting Started (Movie) from the Quick Tips menu located in the lower left-hand corner of the InfoHub.
<br>
Font size -- increase or decrease the default size of the font by using the new triple "A" icon in the header.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving vopt the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.
</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line
  <ol>
  <li>Added a <b>-verbose</b> option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A <b>-ucdbfilename &lt;file&gt;</b> option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any <b>-format &lt;format&gt;</b> option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The <b>-tagseparators &lt;chars&gt;</b> option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
<li>
If the PATH column value is set to "-" it will be ignored (this is useful for the PATH-per-LINK case where one of the LINK values doesn't need a PATH).
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a "Path" column to direct testplan link item matching to a specific region of the design. In addition, a path may be prepended onto any CoverGroup, CoverPoint or Cross link item.<br>
For CoverPoint, CoverGroup, and Cross link items:<ul>
<li>If the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path information will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option to the tag command and the trailing component of the Link column will be parsed as usual and used to match the cover item. Any path added to the string in the Link column will be ignored.</li>
<li>If the Path column is not used or is left blank, and a path is prepended onto the string in the Link column, the prepended path will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option on the tag command.</li></ul>
For CoverItem, Assertion, or Directive link items:<ul>
<li>If the string in the Link column starts with a path separator character, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option in the tag command and no other tag command option is used.</li>
<li>If the string in the Link column does not start with a path separator (in other words, is not a full path), and the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option and the Link strung is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command and no path is specified.</li></ul>
For all other link item types, the contents of the Path column are ignored.
Note: If the Path column for a given link item is the literal string "-", the Path column is ignored for that link item only.
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports test data record tagging. If the Type column for a given link item is "Test", the contents of the Link column will be used as the value of the <b>-testrecord</b> option on the tag command associated with that link item.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a <b>-stylesheet &lt;file&gt;</b> option ("stylesheet=<file>" in the INI file). This option points to an XSL transformation stylesheet which is applied to the imported XML file prior to extraction.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports XML files generated by Jasper's GamePlan testplan utility. Use the <b>-format GamePlan</b> option. </li>
<li>
Use of the "analog" format within the Wave window has been made easier by adding support for the use of <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> to control waveform scaling (the old method required use of "offset" and "scale").</li>
<li>
<h>Font Changes</h><br>
The way fonts are used and configured in the product has changed.  There are now 5 configurable fonts in the product: menuFont, textFont, fixedFont, treeFont, and footerFont.  These fonts are used by all windows and are customer configurable using the Edit Preferences dialog box.  The previous method of configuring fonts is no longer used and the preference variables will be ignored.  The Source window will continue to use it's own font setting as that window shares the font preferences with other products that use the DesignPad text editor.<br>
For current customers upgrading to 6.3b and later releases that have set up customized font preferences, these preferences will have to be manually configured for the new fonts, otherwise the product will look and behave just the same.</li>
<li>
A change to licensing  for this release eliminates extraneous entries in the license server log file that were the result of an availability check for a license feature.    There used to be a license checkout  line (i.e., OUT) followed by a license checkin line (i.e., IN) with 0 time duration each time the application checked on the availability of a license to decide whether to attempt the actual checkout of the license. </li>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GB.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default &lt;size&gt; unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either KB, MB or GB specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code>
vcd limit 6GB<br>
</code>

or<br>

<code>
vcd limit 400MB
</code></li>
<li>
Taglists (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command can now be used to modify local variables in Verilog tasks and functions.</li>
<li>
The profile UI has been modified in the following ways:
<br>- A new pane named "Design Units" has been added to the profile window.  It aggregrates results on a per design unit basis.
<br>- "sum(Mem in)" and "sum(Mem in(%))" columns have been added to the Ranked and Design Units profile panes.  These columns report cumulative values for memory in and memory in %, providing another metric to use when examining memory profile results.
<br>- Memory values are displayed in the profile windows as comma separated numbers rather than with K and M suffixes.  This provides correspondence between
the printed size of the number and its actual value; the goal is to make the data easier to read.
