   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.5 Beta's or 5.4x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * The Windows 95 platform will no longer be supported starting with
       the next major ModelSim release, version 5.6
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 10.2, 11

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * If a Wave or List Window was open during a checkpoint, the
       simulator crashed during a cold restore.
     * The when command syntax now supports bit selects and part selects
       of scalared verilog nets.
       Vectored nets resulting from the use of the -fast switch require
       the use of the 'event qualifier to avoid false activations when
       other bits of the vectored net are changing.
       For example, the following now works in vsim, but may produce
       extra messages if the net remains vectored as a result of having
       been compiled with -fast:
       For a declaration : wire [15:0] a;
       The command
       when {a(3:1) = 3'h7} {echo "matched at time" $now}
       will activate when those bits match and any other bits of the wire
       "a" change.
       To avoid this when using -fast, use the syntax:
       when { a(3:1) = 3'h7 and a(3:1)'event} {echo "matched at time"
       $now}
     * If the restart command was renamed to mti_restart, it would cause
       a kernalUnknownError error during excution. MTI does not
       recommended this command name change.
     * The scroll bar up and down arrow buttons on the Source Window
       stopped working with large source files (>150,000 lines).
     * Moving Verilog memories from the Variables Window to the Wave or
       List Window did not get logged correctly if the process name was
       included in the path.
     * It is now possible to add slices of the results of virtual
       functions to the Wave and List Windows. Events on bits other than
       the chosen slice are filtered out in the Wave Window, but not in
       the List Window.
     * If Edit->Signal Breakpoints->Edit Breakpoint was selected from
       either the Wave or Signals Windows, with the following entries:
        Condition : sim:
        Opt.Label: sim:
        Command(s): echo "Break on sim:" ; stop
       In the Edit When dialog box the always specifies the Condition: ,
       even if an existing breakpoint had a different condition. This now
       indicates the current condition expression.
     * A crash was triggered from using the Compile dialog box. The crash
       was intermittent and only affected the PE product.
     * If the -env option on the examine command was executed "No Data"
       was returned.
     * The library view now displays all design units by default. The
       previous default was to display only loadable design units. The
       view mode can be toggled via the popup menu. A problem with the
       compile order dialog was corrected. The dialog was also enhanced
       to support many files without a performance degredation. The vlib
       and vdir commands have been modified to support FPGA vendor
       properties.
     * The simulator intermittently crashed while zooming/scrolling the
       Wave Window during active simulation.

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * Compiling an event list having an expression involving parameters
       resulted in an internal error.
     * An incorrect .asm file was created when a UDP was refreshed from
       5.4 to 5.5. This resulted in obsolete file format messages when
       loading the design.
     * Information collected about BLOCKs has changed from 5.4 to 5.5. As
       a result, when refreshing a 5.4 library under these cases, the
       vlog compiler must turn off some 5.5 optimization.
     * In some cases, Verilog casex and casez statements were not
       optimized correctly, resulting in default branches being taken
       erroneously. Incorrect optimizations occurred when at least one
       pattern could be disambiguated from all other patterns on the
       basis of certain bits, leaving at least one bit position with X
       (or Z) values.
     * The PATHPULSE statement in SDF allow explicit specification or
       omission of the in_out_path argument. vsim did not handle the
       latter (see example below) and that caused a segmentation
       violation. This is fixed.
( CELL
    ( CELLTYPE "CTS10" )
    ( INSTANCE test_inst )
    (DELAY
        ( ABSOLUTE
            ( IOPATH A Y ( 10.000:10.000:10.000 ))
        )
        (PATHPULSE ( 0 ) )
    )
)
     * Using the +multisource_int_delays switch could cause a crash when
       the load port in the SDF annotation was not driven by the source
       port.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * A defect was fixed in vpi_get_delays() for vpiModPath and vpiTchk
       objects where using vpiScaledRealTime either gave invalid results
       or crashed.
     * While using vpi_iterate() a null pointer dereference could occur
       when iterating on vector ports.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * Use of operators or functions from the package STD_LOGIC_ARITH,
       STD_LOGIC_SIGNED, and STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED, returned incorrect
       values if used in the return statement of a subprogram.
       This problem occurred when the return statement was either:
          + a qualified expression or
          + a type conversion and the operator/function occurred
            immediately within the qualified expression or type
            conversion.
       For example,
       return std_ulogic_vector( a + b); -- this statement shows the
       defect
       return a+b; -- this statement does not show the defect
     * The examine command sometimes returned incorrect results when
       examining the value of a std_logic_vector (also signed and
       unsigned) type function argument where that argument in the call
       to the function was an expression involving std_logic_arith
       functions that return vectors. Simulation results were not
       affected.
     * In ModelSim 5.5 and all previous releases, vcom erroneously
       considered a slice or single bit of a constant to be locally
       static. This has been corrected for 5.5a.
       For example:
       constant A : std_logic_vector(3 downto 0) := "1100";
       alias Addr : std_logic_vector(1 downto 0) is A(1 downto 0);
       alias Xyz : std_logic is A(2);
       constant B : std_logic_vector(2 downto 1) := A(2 downto 1);
       constant C1 : std_logic := A(3);
       Addr, Xyz, B and C1 are not locally static.
       The VHDL compiler performs checks for the usage of such locally
       static expressions in certain constructs. The default behavior of
       vcom has been changed for 5.5a.
         1. The choice in a case statement must be a locally static
            expression. This condition produces a compiler WARNING by
            default (pre-5.5a gave an ERROR). If the '-nocasestaticerror'
            vcom switch is specified, the WARNING message is suppressed.
         2. An array aggregate with multiple choices must have a locally
            static others choice. This condition produces a compiler
            WARNING by default (pre-5.5a gave an ERROR). If the
            '-noothersstaticerror' vcom switch is specified, the WARNING
            message is suppressed.
       A '-pedanticerrors' vcom switch has been added in 5.5a. If this
       switch is specified, the '-nocasestaticerror' or
       '-noothersstaticerror' settings are ignored, and conditions 1 and
       2 above are treated as ERRORs.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.5a
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.5a
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * The VHDL compiler issued an "incompatible mode" error if the VHDL
       component port mode was "buffer" and the corresponding Verilog
       port mode was "out".
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.5a
     * When using the Windows Default printer, the ModelSim setup options
       (e.g. orientation) were not used unless the user opened the
       printers Properties page. If the printer was not the Windows
       Default printer, the setup options were applied.
     * There was a problem in postscript printing where it produced only
       a printout of the grid; no waveforms, no time line, no title.
       An internal Tcl error caused the printing routines to use a font
       size of 0 and consequently not print anything with text since the
       waveform height is based on text height, etc.
       The reason for the Tcl error is not exactly clear; it may have
       been caused by a bad entry in the PrefPostscript array used for
       mapping screen fonts to Postscript fonts. In any event, the
       printing routines now fall back to Helvetica 12 if there is any
       problem resolving which font to use for printing.
     * This was a ModelSim PE only problem. Typing "vcd2wlf" at the
       Modelsim (or VSIM) command prompt produced the error:
       "# channel transcript1 wasn't opened for writing"
       There were two issues:
          + vcd2wlf is not a Modelsim command, but a shell command
          + Modelsim attempted to execute shell commands if no Tcl
            command was found, in PE only, and it ran into a problem with
            the stdin/stdout streams.
       The shell commands "vcd2wlf", "wlf2log", and "tssi2mti" have been
       added as ModelSim commands as well so that Windows users don't
       have to open a DOS Prompt to execute these programs.
       Furthermore, the behavior of executing shell commands if no
       matching Tcl command was found has been fixed to work correctly
       vis-a-vis stdin/stdout streams. The feature has also been enabled
       for ModelSim SE.
       This feature can be disabled by the command "set auto_noexec 1"
       and subsequently re-enabled via "unset auto_noexec" (The command
       "set auto_noexec 0" will do nothing.)
     * Bad machine code was generated for large modules or architectures
       in some cases. This occurred only when the OS allocated memory in
       an unexpected manner. The resulting behavior was that some code
       was skipped and/or the Variables Window showed an incorrect
       context.
     * vcd2wlf was in some cases creating corrupted .wlf files on all
       platforms.
     * ModelSim PE was not able to auto-refresh libraries that were
       previously compiled using ModelSim SE with the "-fast" switch.
     * The simulator crashed when opening more than one dataset if the
       datasets where not from the same design.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mentor Graphics DR's Repaired in 5.5a
     * DR297263 - ModelSim detects a fatal exception at run time caused
       by dereferencing a NULL access type, or when a divide by zero
       occurs. On ModelSim SE 5.5 win32, this caused the simulator to
       crash.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Known Defects in 5.5a
     * In the Project Compiler Settings dialog box, the text "Exclude
       File from Build" runs into the text "Compile to library:"
     * A virtual signal containing a verilog bit is expanded within a
       signals window. Double clicking on this verilog bit to invoke a
       view declaration does not bring up the source window. If the
       source window is already opened, it does not highlight this
       signal.
     * On Win32 platforms when using Mentor Graphics Licensing,
       inappropriate queueing may take place when more than one license
       feature could fulfill a request (e.g., When a VHDL simulator
       license is requested, the user may get queued for a qhsimvh when
       there is an msimhdlsim available). The workaround in GUI mode is
       to cancel the queueing dialog and then the available feature will
       be checked out. The only workaround in command line or batch mode
       is to invoke with the "-lic_noqueue" switch.
     * Virtual signals which are concatenation of a signal from a view
       dataset and a sim dataset show "-No Data-" in the Signals Window
       even after simulation.
     * Virtuals concatenations which contain a virtual constant always
       display a value, even when non-constant children are "-No Data-".
       For example:
       virtual signal {'1' & clk & prdy} foo
     * No waves are displayed in the Wave Window for virtual constants or
       virtual functions that are children of virtuals.
     * In the Source Window select Edit > Find
       The Find dialog box comes up on top of the Source Window. If you
       enter some text and hit Find Next and then move the Find dialog
       box out of the way, the text that was found is not highlighted.
       Highlighting appears to happen only when the next occurrence is
       found and the Find dialog box is not covering it.
     * In the compare wizard, an opened dataset and a sim dataset was
       specified to be compare started.
       Simulation signals had been logged but no simulation run was done
       yet. Also, the button "Update after simulation run" is NOT
       checked.
       On clicking the "Compute Diffs Now" button in the wizard, This
       message was given "Null time range for signal compare". This
       message was not obvious. Maybe the message can be improved to
       "Cannot compare run because No simulation data available yet"
       Now I run 500. If I do a compare info command now, this message is
       given: "No comparison differences" This message was misleading.
       Does it mean my comparisons were all matches? Shouldn't it be "No
       available compare data, please do a compare run or compare update
       first"
       I had not done a compare run or compare update, so there should be
       no compare results or data. The Wave Window is correct at this
       point, the compare signal does not show any compare result.
     * There is an inconsistency in how the path separator works when
       parsing commands. Given that the path separator in the example
       below is "/ ".top.clk should work.
          echo $PathSeparator
              # /
             exa /top/clk
             # 1
              exa /clk
              # 1
              exa clk
             # 1
              exa .top.clk
              # 1
             exa .clk
             # evaluating expression ".clk"
            # No object found matching clk in context /
            # Item '.clk' not found
     * This bug also exists in 5.4e. A virtual signal foo is defined.
       checkpoint command is issued. Then, virtual count gives a count
       of 0. Shouldn't it be 1?
       Nothing is saved during virtual save command. The virtual count
       and save commands before the checkpoint give the correct expected
       results. Also virtual show and virtual describe foo after the
       checkpoint give the correct expected results. virtual count and
       save are not working correctly.
     * Issue with Source Window
       If a src file is in DOS format (with CONTROL M's), it appears as
       double-spaced in the Source Window. This messes up view
       declaration functionality, breakpoints functionality, Process
       Window functionality.
     * Create a List Window with some signals, choose Prop > Display
       Props, select the Triggers page, click on Trigger Gating:
       Expression and press the Use Expression Builder button.  Select a
       signal in the List Window and press the Insert Selected Signal
       button in the Expression Builder.  Nothing happens. The selected
       signal should be added to the expression.
     * When single-stepping in a .coverage_source window, as long as the
       context stays within the current file the coverage numbers can be
       seen to increment with each step. If a step causes another source
       file to be brought up, then the coverage numbers in the first
       column are all screwed up. The only way to fix them is to click on
       the name of the current source file in the coverage_summary
       window, but even this does not always work.
     * In some cases, redhat 6.0 did not have coverage for the entire
       source file. There is no problem with redhat 6.1, 6.2 and 7.0.
     * List Window scrolling problems
          + When using the Find dialog box to find signals, when the next
            signal is outside of what is currently showing in the List
            Window, the window is not scrolled to show the next item
            found.
          + If you do a find to the left and the search goes past the
            beginning of the list to wrap around to the end of the list
            and there's a lot of stuff in the list window that is out of
            view, then the List Window scrolls right only one page even
            though that does not bring the next selected item into view.
          + When doing a search forward on an item's values, the next
            line to match is scrolled to be the top line but the scroll
            bar stays the full length of the scroll bar region.  (This is
            in a List Window where there aren't very many lines of data.)
          + The documentation for the List Window says that the up and
            down arrow keys are supposed to move the line selection up or
            down one line.  The current behavior is that the up and down
            arrow keys behave exactly the same as the TAB and shift-TAB
            keys (searches for next transition).
     * List Window Marker problems
          + If I add a bunch of signals to the List Window then select
            Markers > Add Marker with nothing selected in the List
            Window, then the 2nd list line is highlighted (?).  If I then
            click on another line then no marker outline is left on the
            supposedly added marker line.
          + If I click on some line and do Markers > Add Marker then the
            line I had selected is marked with an outline but the second
            list line is highlighted(!).
          + With a marker added on a particular line, if I then click on
            various lines in the List Window then the marker outline
            occasionally moves to some other line (usually the previously
            selected line). Markers don't stay put.
     * The List Signal Search dialog does not always display the name of
       the selected signal.  Names of the format /top/signame do not
       display.  Names of the format signame do.  If I select multiple
       signals of the first format, all I see are commas in the Signal
       Name(s) box.
     * Loading a tcl shared library fails on rs64.
       ERROR: couldn't load file " testload.sl": readExports: bad magic
     * Compare commands are Wave Window specific.
       In one Wave Window, add some compare signals Compare > Run to
       generate some data. In a new wave window, add some other compare
       signals with some other criteria Compare > Run in this new window.
       The output of the Compare > Differences > Show command gives data
       for both runs. I would think the compare information is Wave
       Window specific since the two windows I have are comparing signals
       with different criteria. Also, the compare (see -prev -next
       buttons) behaves as if both runs are the same.
       That is, if I keep doing -next, the DIFF report will take me from
       one window and jumps to the second. Other commands that are not
       window specific are:
        Compare > Differences > Save
            Compare > Differences > Write Report...
            Compare > Rules > Show
            Compare > Rules > Save
       One behavior which was consistent with what I expect were commands
       like Compare > Differences > Clear. They only cleared the compare
       information in the active Wave Window.
     * In the Projects source area, Windows 95 drag and drop from windows
       explorer does not work.
     * This problem only affects Windows environment. When trying to
       compile a source file within ModelSim, you may get a dialog
       message similar to below:
       "foo.vhd" was modified after it was compiled
       Compiled at Wed Apr 04 14:53:38 Pacific Daylight Time 2001
       (986421218),
       file modified Wed Apr 04 13:53:38 Pacific Daylight Time 2001
       (986417618)
       This is a problem due to a difference in time reporting between
       single and multi threaded libraries on the Windows platform. The
       compiler uses one, and the GUI uses the other, resulting in a
       disagreement in the current time.
       Please disregard this dialog box. After you OK the dialog box for
       a particular file, it should not appear again for that file in the
       current ModelSim session.
     * Vish crashed when the following sequence of commands were used in
       a compare session. The crash occurred at compare end.

   Product Changes to 5.5a
     * There is a change in the default behavior on how regions in a
       design are saved in the WLF file. In 5.5a, only the hierarchical
       regions containing the logged signals are saved.
       The user can toggle between this default and saving all regions in
       a design using the WLFSaveAllRegions variable in the modelsim.ini
       file, or from the Simulation Options dialog on the WLF Files tab.
       This change affects the current behavior in the following ways:
         1. Some regions in the design may not exist in -view mode.
         2. The WLF file in large designs with few logged signals may be
            significantly smaller. (In one test case there were only 25
            logged signals which had a few hundred thousands of event
            data but 40Meg of region information.)
