<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
 You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
 5.5 Beta's or 5.4x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries" in
 the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
</li>
<li>
The Windows 95 platform will no longer be supported starting with the next major ModelSim release, version 5.6
</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 10.2, 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a Wave or List Window was open during a checkpoint, the simulator crashed 
during a cold restore.


</li>
<li>
The <b>when</b> command syntax now supports bit selects
and part selects of scalared verilog nets. 

<p>
Vectored nets resulting from the use of the -fast switch 
require the use of the 'event qualifier to avoid false 
activations when other bits of the vectored net are changing.

<p>
For example, the following now works in vsim, but
may produce extra messages if the net remains
vectored as a result of having been compiled with
-fast:

<p>
For a declaration : <code>wire [15:0] a;</code>

<p>
The command<br><br>

<code>
 when {a(3:1) = 3'h7} {echo "matched at time" $now}
</code>
<br><br>
will activate when those bits match and any other
bits of the wire "a" change.

<p>
To avoid this when using -fast, use the syntax:<br><br>

<code>
  when { a(3:1) = 3'h7 and a(3:1)'event} {echo "matched at time" $now}
</code>
<br><br>

</li>
<li>
If the <b>restart</b> command was renamed to mti_restart, it would cause
a kernalUnknownError error during excution. MTI does not recommended 
this command name change. 

</li>
<li>
The scroll bar up and down arrow buttons on the Source Window stopped working 
with large source files (>150,000 lines).

</li>
<li>
Moving Verilog memories from the Variables Window to the
Wave or List Window did not get logged correctly if 
the process name was included in the path.

</li>
<li>
It is now possible to add slices of the results of virtual 
functions to the Wave and List Windows. Events on bits other 
than the chosen slice are filtered out in the Wave Window, 
but not in the List Window. 
 

</li>
<li>
If <b>Edit->Signal Breakpoints->Edit Breakpoint</b> was selected 
from either the Wave or Signals Windows, with the following entries:
<PRE>
        Condition : sim:<signal_name>
        Opt.Label: sim:<signal_name>
        Command(s): echo "Break on sim:<signal_name>" ; stop
</PRE>
In the <b>Edit When</b> dialog box the always specifies the Condition: 
<signal_name>, even if an existing breakpoint had a different condition. 
This now indicates the current condition expression.
</li>
<li>
A crash was triggered from using the Compile dialog box.
The crash was intermittent and only affected the PE 
product.
</li>
<li>
If the -env option on the <b>examine</b> command was executed "No Data"
was returned.
</li>
<li>
The library view now displays all design units by default. 
The previous default was to display only loadable design units.
The view mode can be toggled via the popup menu. A problem with the
compile order dialog was corrected. The dialog was also enhanced to
support many files without a performance degredation. The vlib and vdir
commands have been modified to support FPGA vendor properties.
</li>
<li>
The simulator intermittently crashed while zooming/scrolling
the Wave Window during active simulation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Compiling an event list having an expression involving parameters
resulted in an internal error.
</li>
<li>
An incorrect .asm file was created when a UDP was refreshed
from 5.4 to 5.5.  This resulted in obsolete file format messages when
loading the design. 
</li>
<li>
Information collected about BLOCKs has changed from 5.4 to 5.5.  As a
result, when refreshing a 5.4 library under these cases, the vlog compiler 
must turn off some 5.5 optimization.

</li>
<li>
In some cases, Verilog casex and casez statements were not optimized
correctly, resulting in default branches being taken erroneously.
Incorrect optimizations occurred when at least one pattern could be
disambiguated from all other patterns on the basis of certain bits,
leaving at least one bit position with X (or Z) values.
</li>
<li>
The PATHPULSE statement in SDF allow explicit specification or omission
of the in_out_path argument. vsim did not handle the latter (see example
below) and that caused a segmentation violation. This is fixed.

<p>
<code>
<pre>
( CELL
    ( CELLTYPE "CTS10" )
    ( INSTANCE test_inst )
    (DELAY
        ( ABSOLUTE
            ( IOPATH A Y ( 10.000:10.000:10.000 ))
        )
        (PATHPULSE ( 0 ) )
    )
)
</pre>
</code>
</li>
<li>
Using the +multisource_int_delays switch  could cause a crash when
the load port in the SDF annotation was not driven by the source port.


</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
A defect was fixed in vpi_get_delays() for vpiModPath and vpiTchk objects
where using vpiScaledRealTime either gave invalid results or crashed.
</li>
<li>
While using vpi_iterate() a null pointer dereference could
occur when iterating on vector ports.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
Use of operators or functions from the package STD_LOGIC_ARITH,
STD_LOGIC_SIGNED, and
STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED, returned incorrect values if used in the return
statement of a subprogram.
<p>
This problem occurred when the return statement was either:
<ul>
<li>a qualified expression or
<li>a type conversion and the operator/function occurred immediately within
the qualified expression
or type conversion.
</ul>
<p>
For example, <br>
return std_ulogic_vector( a + b);  -- this statement shows the defect<br>
return a+b;      -- this statement does not show the defect<br>



</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b> command sometimes returned incorrect results when examining
the value of a std_logic_vector (also signed and unsigned) type function
argument where that argument in the call to the function was an expression
involving std_logic_arith functions that return vectors.  Simulation results
were not affected.
</li>
<li>
In ModelSim 5.5 and all previous releases, vcom erroneously considered 
a slice or single bit of a constant to be locally static. This has been 
corrected for 5.5a. 

<p>
For example:<br><br> 

<code>
  constant A   : std_logic_vector(3 downto 0) := "1100";<br>
  alias Addr : std_logic_vector(1 downto 0) is A(1 downto 0); <br>
  alias Xyz : std_logic is A(2); <br>
  constant B : std_logic_vector(2 downto 1) := A(2 downto 1); <br>
  constant C1 : std_logic := A(3); <br>
</code>

<p>
Addr, Xyz, B and C1 are not locally static. 

<p>
The VHDL compiler performs checks for the usage of such locally static 
expressions in certain constructs. The default behavior of vcom has been 
changed for 5.5a. 

<ol>
<li>
The choice in a case statement must be a locally static expression. 
This condition produces a compiler WARNING by default (pre-5.5a gave an ERROR). 
If the '<em>-nocasestaticerror</em>' vcom switch is specified, the WARNING
message is suppressed. 

<li>
An array aggregate with multiple choices must have a locally static others 
choice. 
This condition produces a compiler WARNING by default (pre-5.5a gave an ERROR). 
If the '<em>-noothersstaticerror</em>' vcom switch is specified,
the WARNING message is suppressed. 
</ol>

<p>
A '<em>-pedanticerrors</em>' vcom switch has been added in 5.5a. If this 
switch is specified, the '<em>-nocasestaticerror</em>' or 
'<em>-noothersstaticerror</em>' settings are ignored, 
and conditions 1 and 2 above are treated as ERRORs. 
  

</li>

component port mode was "buffer" and the corresponding Verilog port
mode was "out".

<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
When using the Windows Default printer, the ModelSim setup options (e.g. 
orientation) were not used unless the user opened the printers Properties page.
If the printer was not the Windows Default printer, the setup options
were applied.
</li>
<li>
There was a problem in postscript printing where it produced only a 
printout of the grid; no waveforms, no time line, no title.

<p>
An internal Tcl error caused the printing 
routines to use a font size of 0 and 
consequently not print anything with text since 
the waveform height is based on text height, etc.

<p>
The reason for the Tcl error is not exactly 
clear; it may have been caused by a bad entry 
in the PrefPostscript array used for mapping 
screen fonts to Postscript fonts.  In any 
event, the printing routines now fall back to
Helvetica 12 if there is any problem resolving
which font to use for printing.

</li>
<li>
This was a ModelSim PE only problem. Typing "vcd2wlf" at the Modelsim (or VSIM)
command prompt produced the error:<br><br>

<code> 
"# channel transcript1 wasn't opened for writing"
</code>

<p>
There were two issues:
<ul>
<li><em>vcd2wlf</em> is not a Modelsim command, but a shell command
<li>Modelsim attempted to execute shell commands if no 
Tcl command was found, in PE only, and it ran
into a problem with the stdin/stdout streams.
</ul>

<p>
The shell commands "<em>vcd2wlf</em>", "<em>wlf2log</em>", and
"<em>tssi2mti</em>" have been added as ModelSim commands 
as well so that Windows users don't have to 
open a DOS Prompt to execute these programs.

<p>
Furthermore, the behavior of executing shell commands 
if no matching Tcl command was found has been
fixed to work correctly vis-a-vis stdin/stdout
streams. The feature has also been enabled for
ModelSim SE.

<p>
This feature can be disabled by the command
"<em>set auto_noexec 1</em>" and
subsequently re-enabled via "<em>unset auto_noexec</em>"
(The command "<em>set auto_noexec 0</em>" will do nothing.)

</li>
<li>
Bad machine code was generated for large modules or architectures in some cases.
This occurred only when the OS allocated memory in an unexpected manner.
The resulting behavior was that some code was skipped and/or the Variables
Window showed an incorrect context.
</li>
<li>
vcd2wlf was in some cases creating corrupted .wlf files on all platforms.

</li>
<li>
ModelSim PE was not able to auto-refresh libraries that were 
previously compiled using ModelSim SE with the "-fast" switch.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when opening more than one dataset if the datasets 
where not from the same design.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>

<p><a NAME="mgcdefects"></a><b>Mentor Graphics DR's Repaired in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
DR297263 - ModelSim detects a fatal exception at run time caused by
dereferencing a NULL access type, or when a divide by zero occurs. On ModelSim
SE 5.5 win32, this caused the simulator to crash.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
In the Project Compiler Settings dialog box,
the text "Exclude File from Build" runs into 
the text "Compile to library:"


</li>
<li>
A virtual signal containing a verilog bit is expanded
within a signals window. Double clicking on this verilog bit
to invoke a view declaration does not bring up the source window. 
If the source window is already opened, it does not highlight
this signal.

</li>
<li>
On Win32 platforms when using Mentor Graphics Licensing, 
inappropriate queueing may take place when more than one 
license feature could
fulfill a request (e.g., When a VHDL simulator license is requested, 
the user may get queued for a qhsimvh when there is an msimhdlsim
available). The workaround in GUI mode is to cancel the queueing 
dialog and then the available feature will be checked out.  The only
workaround in command line or batch mode is to invoke with 
the "-lic_noqueue" switch. 
</li>
<li>
Virtual signals which are concatenation of a signal from a view 
dataset and a sim dataset show "-No Data-" in the Signals Window even after
     simulation. 
</li>
<li>
Virtuals concatenations which contain a virtual constant always 
display a value, even when non-constant children are "-No Data-".
For example: <br>
<code>virtual signal {'1' & clk & prdy} foo</code>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
No waves are displayed in the Wave Window for virtual constants or virtual 
functions that are children of virtuals. 
</li>
<li>
In the Source Window select Edit > Find
<p>
The Find dialog box 
comes up on top of the Source Window. If you enter some text and hit Find
     Next and then move the Find dialog box out of the way, the 
text that was found is not highlighted.
<p>
Highlighting appears to 
happen only when the next occurrence is found and the Find dialog box is not 
covering it.
</li>
<li>
In the compare wizard, an opened dataset and a sim dataset was specified 
to be compare started.
<p>
Simulation signals had been logged but no
     simulation run was done yet. Also, the button 
"Update after simulation run" is NOT checked.
<p>
On clicking the "Compute Diffs Now" button in the
     wizard, This message was given "Null time range for signal compare". 
This message was not obvious. Maybe the message can be improved to
     "Cannot compare run because No simulation data available yet"
<p>
Now I run 500. If I do a compare info command now, this message is given: "No
     comparison differences" This message was misleading. Does it 
mean my comparisons were all matches? Shouldn't it be "No available compare
     data, please do a compare run or compare update first"
<p>
I had not done a compare run or compare update, so there should be no compare
     results or data. The Wave Window is correct at this point, 
the compare signal does not show any compare result. 
</li>
<li>
There is an inconsistency in how the path separator works when parsing
commands. Given that the path separator in the example below is "/ ".top.clk
should work.

<ul>&nbsp; echo $PathSeparator
<br>&nbsp; # /
<br>&nbsp;exa /top/clk
<br>&nbsp;# 1
<br>&nbsp; exa /clk
<br>&nbsp; # 1
<br>&nbsp; exa clk
<br>&nbsp;# 1
<br>&nbsp; exa .top.clk
<br>&nbsp; # 1
<br>&nbsp;exa .clk
<br>&nbsp;# evaluating expression ".clk"
<br># No object found matching clk in context /
<br># Item '.clk' not found</ul>

</li>
<li>
This bug also exists in 5.4e. A virtual signal foo is defined. 
<b>checkpoint</b>
command is issued. Then, virtual count gives a count of 0. Shouldn't it
be 1?
<p>
Nothing is saved during <b>virtual save</b> command. The <b>virtual
count </b>and <b>save</b> commands before the checkpoint give the correct
expected results. Also <b>virtual show</b> and <b>virtual describe</b>
foo after the checkpoint give the correct expected results. virtual count
and save are not working correctly.
</li>
<li>
Issue with Source Window

<p>
If a src file is in DOS format (with CONTROL M's), it appears as 
double-spaced in the Source Window. This messes up view declaration 
functionality, breakpoints functionality, Process Window functionality.
</li>
<li>
Create a List Window with some signals, choose <b>Prop &gt; Display Props</b>,
select the Triggers page, click on Trigger Gating: Expression and press
the Use Expression Builder button.&nbsp; Select a signal in the List Window
and press the Insert Selected Signal button in the Expression Builder.&nbsp;
Nothing happens. The selected signal should be added to the expression.
</li>
<li>
When single-stepping in a .coverage_source window, as long as the
context stays within the current file the coverage numbers can be seen
to increment with each step.  If a step causes another source file
to be brought up, then the coverage numbers in the first column are all
screwed up.  The only way to fix them is to click on the name of the
current source file in the coverage_summary window, but even this does
not always work.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, redhat 6.0 did not have coverage for the entire source file. There is no problem with redhat 
6.1, 6.2 and 7.0.
</li>
<li>
List Window scrolling problems

<ul>
<li>
When using the Find dialog box to find signals, when the next signal is
outside of what is currently showing in the List Window, the window is
not scrolled to show the next item found.</li>

<li>
If you do a find to the left and the search goes past the beginning of
the list to wrap around to the end of the list and there's a lot of stuff
in the list window that is out of view, then the List Window scrolls right
only one page even though that does not bring the next selected item into
view.</li>

<li>
When doing a search forward on an item's values, the next line to match
is scrolled to be the top line but the scroll bar stays the full length
of the scroll bar region.&nbsp; (This is in a List Window where there aren't
very many lines of data.)</li>

<li>
The documentation for the List Window says that the up and down arrow keys
are supposed to move the line selection up or down one line.&nbsp; The
current behavior is that the up and down arrow keys behave exactly the
same as the TAB and shift-TAB keys (searches for next transition).</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
List Window Marker problems

<ul>
<li>
If I add a bunch of signals to the List Window then select <b>Markers &gt;
Add Marker</b> with nothing selected in the List Window, then the 2nd list
line is highlighted (?).&nbsp; If I then click on another line then no
marker outline is left on the supposedly added marker line.</li>

<li>
If I click on some line and do <b>Markers > Add Marker</b> then the line
I had selected is marked with an outline but the second list line is 
highlighted(!).</li>

<li>
With a marker added on a particular line, if I then click on various lines
in the List Window then the marker outline occasionally moves to some other
line (usually the previously selected line). Markers don't stay put.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
The List Signal Search dialog does not always display the name of the selected
signal.&nbsp; Names of the format /top/signame do not display.&nbsp; Names
of the format signame do.&nbsp; If I select multiple signals of the first
format, all I see are commas in the Signal Name(s) box.
</li>
<li>
Loading a tcl shared library fails on rs64.
<p>
<code>ERROR: couldn't load file " testload.sl": readExports: bad magic</code>

</li>
<li>
Compare commands are Wave Window specific.

<p>
In one Wave Window, add some compare signals <b>Compare > Run</b> to
generate some data. In a new wave window, add some other compare signals
with some other criteria <b>Compare > Run</b> in this new window.
<p>
The output
of the <b>Compare > Differences > Show</b> command gives data for both
runs. I would think the compare information is Wave Window specific since
the two windows I have are comparing signals with different criteria.
Also, the compare (see -prev -next buttons) behaves as if both runs are
the same.
<p>
That is, if I keep doing -next, the DIFF report will take
me from one window and jumps to the second. Other commands that are not
window specific are:
<ul><b>Compare > Differences > Save</b>
<br><b>Compare > Differences > Write Report...</b>
<br><b>Compare > Rules > Show</b>
<br><b>Compare > Rules > Save</b></ul>
<p>
One behavior which was consistent with what I expect were commands like
<b>Compare
> Differences > Clear</b>. They only cleared the compare information in
the active Wave Window.

</li>
<li>
In the Projects source area, Windows 95 drag and drop from windows explorer
does not work.
</li>
<li>
This problem only affects Windows environment. When trying to compile 
a source file 
within ModelSim, you may get a dialog message similar to below:
<p>
<code>
"foo.vhd" was modified after it was compiled<br>
Compiled at Wed Apr 04 14:53:38 Pacific Daylight Time 2001 (986421218),<br>
file modified Wed Apr 04 13:53:38 Pacific Daylight Time 2001 (986417618)<br>
</code>

<p>
This is a problem due to a difference in time reporting between single and 
multi threaded libraries on the Windows platform.  The compiler uses one,
and the GUI uses the other, resulting in a disagreement in the current
time. 

<p>
Please disregard this dialog box.  After you OK the dialog box for a
particular file, it should not appear again for that file in the current
ModelSim session.

</li>
<li>
Vish crashed when the following sequence of commands were used in a
compare session. The crash occurred at compare end.

<p>
<code>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 5.5a</b>
<ul>
<li>
There is a change in the default behavior on
how regions in a design are saved in the WLF file. In 5.5a, only the 
hierarchical regions containing the logged signals are saved.

<p>
The user can toggle between this default and saving all regions in a 
design using the <em>WLFSaveAllRegions</em> variable in the
modelsim.ini file, or from the Simulation Options dialog on
the WLF Files tab.

<p>
This change affects the current behavior in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>Some regions in the design may not exist in -view mode.
<li>The WLF file in large designs with few logged signals 
may be significantly smaller.  (In one test case there were
only 25 logged signals which had a few hundred thousands of event 
data but 40Meg of region information.)
</ol>
