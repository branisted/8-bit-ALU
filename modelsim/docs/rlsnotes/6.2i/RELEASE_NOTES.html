<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2i</b>
<ul>
<li>
Unable to <b>add list</b> or <b>add wave</b> an object when the path contained an array instance.</li>
<li>
An event at time 0 on a Verilog named event did not displayed in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Remove erroneous "TTV Format" item from the Restart dialog.</li>
<li>
In certain cases the vish process grew too large and eventually ran out of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2i</b>
<ul>
<li>
When a part-select into a memory element was out-of-bounds, we were returning 0's instead of x's for the out-of-range spots.</li>
<li>
Always_comb sensitivity to a slice of an element of a packed struct was not being correctly set.</li>
<li>
The vopt compiler crashed when setuphold/recrem timing checks had argument conditions and event conditions.</li>
<li>
In some cases, specializations of parameterized classes within other parameterized classes would lead to inconsistent sets of types and cause incorrect errors regarding assignment incompatibilities.</li>
<li>
If a VHDL (or other non-Verilog design unit) instantiated more than one child instance that made use of complex parameterized class relationships, memory assertions could incorrectly result during elaboration.</li>
<li>
Starting in release 6.2h, VHDL design units that reference Verilog design units began to report an out-of-date error when inconsequential changes were made to the Verilog module.  The previous behavior has been restored so this error should only occur if changes in the Verilog model could have some impact on the VHDL code.</li>
<li>
vsim invocation with <b>-novopt</b> and <b>-v2k_int_delays</b> caused vsim to hang
in certain cases.
</li>
<li>
A blocking assignment having an intra-assignment timing control was optimized away in some cases, resulting in the incorrect side effect of losing the delay in the block of sequential statements.</li>
<li>
Two problems with annotating DEVICE statements with compiled SDF were fixed. 
</li>
<li>
Hierarchical reference to an UDP port caused vopt to crash.</li>
<li>
When analyzing a System Verilog compilation unit containing declarations in $unit and at least one package, certain errors would be reported more than once, with earlier errors having misleading or missing file names.</li>
<li>
An optimized design containing a blocking assignment followed by a delayed non-blocking assignment to the same register in the same initial block resulted in a compiler crash provided these were the only assignments to the register.</li>
<li>
Unconnected UDP terminals resulted in a simulator elaboration crash.</li>
<li>
Multiple simultaneous delayed non-blocking assignments to a variable (with the intention of producing a pulse on the variable) inside of a "clocked" always block failed if the delays were longer than the clock period.</li>
<li>
If a VHDL (or other non-Verilog design unit) instantiated more than one child instance that made use of complex parameterized class relationships, memory assertions could incorrectly result during elaboration.</li>
<li>
The <b>+libext</b> compile option was ignored for use by the <b>-y</b> compile options if the design also contained `uselib directives having libext entries.</li>
<li>
Modules that were found and compiled as a result of `uselib compiler directives were incorrectly listed in a compiler message as being "Referenced (but uncompiled) modules or primitives".</li>
<li>
An optimized design having multiple continuous assignments with identical rhs expressions and different width lhs expressions could produce incorrect results in some cases.</li>
<li>
When <b>-v2k_int_delays</b> was specified on the vsim command line, 0 delay MIPDs were inserted even when there were no SDF files specified. This caused slower performance and in some cases a crash.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed were an optimized Verilog gate-level cell was instanciated under a VHDL netlist.</li>

When a package was compiled with the default optimization level (absent <b>-On</b> option), and a design unit that depends on the package was compiled with <b>-O0</b> or with coverage (which forces <b>-O0</b>), bad code for the design unit could result in a simulator crash.</li>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.2i</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a wlf file while running
on a Linux 64 bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
"add wave" command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32 bit Linux OS.

This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.

A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option -wlfnolock.

</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.</li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
