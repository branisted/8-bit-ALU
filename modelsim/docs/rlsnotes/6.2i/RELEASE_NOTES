   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * Unable to add list or add wave an object when the path contained an
       array instance.
     * An event at time 0 on a Verilog named event did not displayed in the
       Wave window.
     * Remove erroneous "TTV Format" item from the Restart dialog.
     * In certain cases the vish process grew too large and eventually ran out
       of memory.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * When a part-select into a memory element was out-of-bounds, we were
       returning 0's instead of x's for the out-of-range spots.
     * Always_comb sensitivity to a slice of an element of a packed struct was
       not being correctly set.
     * The  vopt compiler crashed when setuphold/recrem timing checks had
       argument conditions and event conditions.
     * In some cases, specializations of parameterized classes within other
       parameterized classes would lead to inconsistent sets of types and cause
       incorrect errors regarding assignment incompatibilities.
     * If a VHDL (or other non-Verilog design unit) instantiated more than one
       child  instance  that  made  use  of  complex  parameterized class
       relationships,  memory  assertions could incorrectly result during
       elaboration.
     * Starting in release 6.2h, VHDL design units that reference Verilog
       design units began to report an out-of-date error when inconsequential
       changes were made to the Verilog module. The previous behavior has been
       restored so this error should only occur if changes in the Verilog model
       could have some impact on the VHDL code.
     * vsim invocation with -novopt and -v2k_int_delays caused vsim to hang in
       certain cases.
     * A blocking assignment having an intra-assignment timing control was
       optimized away in some cases, resulting in the incorrect side effect of
       losing the delay in the block of sequential statements.
     * Two problems with annotating DEVICE statements with compiled SDF were
       fixed.
     * Hierarchical reference to an UDP port caused vopt to crash.
     * When analyzing a System Verilog compilation unit containing declarations
       in $unit and at least one package, certain errors would be reported more
       than once, with earlier errors having misleading or missing file names.
     * An optimized design containing a blocking assignment followed by a
       delayed non-blocking assignment to the same register in the same initial
       block  resulted  in  a compiler crash provided these were the only
       assignments to the register.
     * Unconnected UDP terminals resulted in a simulator elaboration crash.
     * Multiple simultaneous delayed non-blocking assignments to a variable
       (with the intention of producing a pulse on the variable) inside of a
       "clocked" always block failed if the delays were longer than the clock
       period.
     * If a VHDL (or other non-Verilog design unit) instantiated more than one
       child  instance  that  made  use  of  complex  parameterized class
       relationships,  memory  assertions could incorrectly result during
       elaboration.
     * The +libext compile option was ignored for use by the -y compile options
       if the design also contained `uselib directives having libext entries.
     * Modules that were found and compiled as a result of `uselib compiler
       directives  were incorrectly listed in a compiler message as being
       "Referenced (but uncompiled) modules or primitives".
     * An  optimized  design  having multiple continuous assignments with
       identical rhs expressions and different width lhs expressions could
       produce incorrect results in some cases.
     * When -v2k_int_delays was specified on the vsim command line, 0 delay
       MIPDs were inserted even when there were no SDF files specified. This
       caused slower performance and in some cases a crash.
     * The simulator crashed were an optimized Verilog gate-level cell was
       instanciated under a VHDL netlist.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2i
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * When a package was compiled with the default optimization level (absent
       -On option), and a design unit that depends on the package was compiled
       with -O0 or with coverage (which forces -O0), bad code for the design
       unit could result in a simulator crash.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.2i
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.2i
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * Fixed sccom link issue with merging debug databases when one library had
       an sc_fifo and another had an sc_fifo port (sc_fifo_in or sc_fifo_out).
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.2i
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * An attempt to capture extended VCD for a VHDL design unit having an
       inout port connected to a hierarchically referenced Verilog net resulted
       in a vsim-VCD-3202 error if the hierarchical reference was to a net not
       in the parent hierarchy of the instantiation.
     * All files within libraries were created with permissions 666 (read/write
       access for user/group/other), ignoring the current umask setting.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * The vcover merge command crashed on UCDB files having SystemC class
       hierarchy.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.2i
     * vopt gave wrong results or crashed in some cases when an entity in the
       work library instantiates an entity in a second library, and the second
       entity instantiates an entity or module back in the work library.
     * The vsim -load_elab option did not respect the -wlf option and instead
       used the default wlf file name or the name of the wlf file used at -elab
       time.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.2i
     * dts0100412556 - vsim errors when attempting to add an array of instances
       to the Wave window.
     * dts0100415063 - Verilog events at t=0 are not displayed in the Wave
       window.
     * dts0100410867 - Index out of range error not being identified.
     * dts0100412166 - # ** Fatal: Unexpected signal: 11. with vopt.
     * dts0100415461 - Memory failure. ***** message while loading random.
     * dts0100420419 - Crash when -v2k_int_delays is used.
     * dts0100412443 - vopt and vsim binding is not the same.
     * dts0100421105 - Vish process size grows if use when loops in do files in
       GUI.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.2i
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a wlf file while running
       on a Linux 64 bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
       "add wave" command, when the working directory was created under an
       older 32 bit Linux OS. This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot
       be fixed by the simulator. A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to
       execute the simulator with command line option -wlfnolock.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * 'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task
       calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is
       treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
