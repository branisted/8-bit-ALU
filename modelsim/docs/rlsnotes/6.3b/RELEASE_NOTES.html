<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The presence of non-debug items in a System Verilog design could cause dataflow connectivity to be incomplete.</li>
<li>
The precision of Verification Management window (browser and tracker) can be changed now.  Either issue "set PrefUCDB(Precision) <no>" or go through "Edit Preference" dialog.</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b> command gives inconsistent or incorrect results in some cases involving local variables.  In some cases, class variables are not reachable.</li>
<li>
Dragging a file into vsim and crossing the Project pane boundary can sometimes result in a Tcl error.</li>
<li>
Shared variables of or containing Access Types cannot be expanded in the Objects window.</li>
<li>
The Coverage Miss windows do not display coverage information when a Package is selected in the Workspace, only when selecting the source files listed in the Files tab.  This has been changed so that selection of a package will show the package coverage information.</li>
<li>
Font configurations do not work correctly and some fonts are just not configurable.  This issue has been resolved with a change in the way fonts are handled in the product.  See Font Changes in the Product Changes section for details.</li>
<li>
The Source window did not properly display PSL files (no keyword highlight was done). New PSL plugins have been added which fixes this.</li>
<li>
When you double-click in the Source window on an `include file name, sometimes the source for that include file did not open.</li>
<li>
The textual dataflow feature in the Source window failed to trace drivers in cases where the driving process was merged (due to optimizations) with other processes.  </li>
<li>
The "Change Directory" dialog box has been changed on Windows only to a native Windows dialog that supports Windows aliases and shortcuts.</li>
<li>
In certain cases the vish process grew too large and eventually ran out of memory.</li>
<li>
Using <b>-viewcov</b> while there is an active simulation will cause the simulation to unload (i.e. quit -sim).  Also, multiple <b>vsim -viewcov</b> commands will cause prior coverage dataset to be unaccessible from the U/I.  These problems have been resolved.  A new command has also been added to facilitate loading multiple coverage datasets for viewing.  The command <b>coverage open <filename></b> is equivalent to the command <b>vsim -viewcov <filename></b>.</li>
<li>
Configuring columns and user attributes are now supported in Test Tracker pane.</li>
<li>
Removed Tools->"Code Coverage"->Save... and Tools->"Functional Coverage"->Save...
menus to merge those dialogs and add to the Tools->"Coverage Save..." menu to have
a combined save dialog for code coverage and functional coverage items.</li>
<li>
Three modes of messages, Concise, Verbose and Quiet, are consistenly supported in the Rank and Merge dialog for Test Browser, and the Rank dialog for Test Tracker.</li>
<li>
The Column User and UserIncr now are hidden by default in Test Browser Pane.</li>
<li>
The <b>add testbrowser</b> command now accepts multiple files as arguments.</li>
<li>
The <b>add testbrowser</b> command had problems if the input file was not in the current directory.</li>
<li>
The precision of the test tracker pane now can be set by the user.  Either from the "Edit Preference" dialog or directly do "set PrefUCDB(Precision) <no>" in the Transcript window.</li>
<li>
Expanding a dynamic array or queue in the locals window multiple times can result in stale data being displayed in the expanded view.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
An optimized design containing a blocking assignment followed by a delayed non-blocking assignment to the same register in the same initial block resulted in a compiler crash provided these were the only assignments to the register.</li>
<li>
Unconnected UDP terminals resulted in a simulator elaboration crash.</li>
<li>
Multiple simultaneous delayed non-blocking assignments to a variable (with the intention of producing a pulse on the variable) inside of a "clocked" always block failed if the delays were longer than the clock period.</li>
<li>
The 'var' keyword was not allowed on ports.</li>
<li>
File name fix for errors found in series of include files.</li>
<li>
The <b>+libext</b> compile option was ignored for use by the <b>-y</b> compile options if the design also contained `uselib directives having libext entries.</li>
<li>
Modules that were found and compiled as a result of `uselib compiler directives were incorrectly listed in a compiler message as being "Referenced (but uncompiled) modules or primitives".</li>
<li>
An optimized design having multiple continuous assignments with identical rhs expressions and different width lhs expressions could produce incorrect results in some cases.</li>
<li>
Precision of parameters of type real was lost past 6 digits to the right of the decimal point in an optimized design.</li>
<li>
Verilog macros containing unnamed blocks with local variable declarations could cause errors like:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'#ublk#0#14' already exists; must not be redefined as a named block
</code>
<br>or<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vtree.c(14444)</code>
</li>
<li>
When <b>-v2k_int_delays</b> was specified on the vsim command line, 0 delay MIPDs were inserted even when there were no SDF files specified. This caused an unnecessary slow down and in some cases a crash.
</li>
<li>
Calling a task or function with a <code>return</code> statement from an <code>initial</code>/<code>always</code>/<code>final</code> 
block may cause a crash in vlog if the task/function does not contain any named 
blocks or local variables, but the initial/always/final block is named or
contains local variables.</li>
<li>
Fixed simulation crash were optimized Verilog gate-level cell is instanciated under a VHDL netlist.</li>
<li>
Verilog event triggers were not compiled compatibly between SunOS 5 and Linux platforms.
</li>
<li>
LRM requirements regarding consistency between class "extern" method headers and the method implementation were not being enforced.</li>
<li>
If a value parameter of a parameterized class depended on an earlier type parameter, incorrect values could occur in the value parameter.
</li>
<li>
Incorrect errors regarding incompatible types were reported when extern class methods had arguments of array types.</li>
<li>
Verilog compilation would fail with an internal error if an array was defined with a parameterized class specialization as the element type.</li>
<li>
Elaboration could fail if the definition of a forward type referenced a parameter that was declared between the forward and the actual type definition.</li>
<li>
Class objects were handled inconsistently in boolean contexts.</li>
<li>
An attempt to invoke 'rand_mode' on a rand field of a parameterized class resulted in a vsim elaboration error. This has been fixed (i.e. this use of rand_mode now works correctly).</li>
<li>
A directory cache was added to the Verilog compiler so that the <b>-y</b> option would work more quickly when a directory was searched multiple times.</li>
<li>
vopt crashed while loading a configuration in which the instance statement specified a top-level module without a use clause.
</li>
<li>
If the same production name was used in two separate randsequence statements, one of the productions was incorrectly shared by both randsequence statements.
Now productions with the name occurring in separate randsequence statement are maintained as unique productions.</li>
<li>
When a net was used as an attribute in the System Verilog transaction recording interface it resulted in an error message and was not recorded properly.</li>
<li>
In vopt, when analyzing a parent module containing multiple instances of a child containing a large number of similar instantiations, vopt could fail with an internal error.</li>
<li>
Improvements have been made in error reporting for `ifdef\`else\`endif directives.
</li>
<li>
The usage of ".*" for implicit port connection causes too much memory to be consumed especially in Verilog designs with a large netlists.  </li>
<li>
Parsing continues after a bad class extension declaration to produce a cascade of errors to assist in debugging.</li>
<li>
If the target of System Verilog bind is VHDL and one of the actuals of bind is an enum expression that maps to a Verilog vector formal, an internal error may be caused in vsim.</li>
<li>
Fixed an issue that would cause vlog to generate spurious errors whenever out-of-block constraint bodies were defined before protected out-of-block class method bodies.</li>
<li>
Verilog arrays were sometimes displayed in the Wave window with the elements in reversed order.</li>
<li>
vlog <b>-lint</b> erroneously complained about "undefined variables" if implicit .* port connections were encountered.</li>
<li>
A clocking block synchronous drive failed when using a bit-select or slice on the left hand side of the clocking drive.</li>
<li>
If the value on the right hand side of a clocking block synchronous drive matched the value of the previous clocking drive for an output or inout then incorrect behaviour could result.</li>
<li>
A clocking block hierarchical expression referencing an interface element when the clocking block is in a program block incorrectly caused elaboration error vsim-3927.</li>
<li>
A memory leak affecting Verilog on the linux_x86_64 platform was ameliorated.</li>
<li>
Packages were silently permitted in Verilog instantiations.  This is now
an error.</li>
<li>
When vopt was not used, the simulator would fail to load a module from a library specified within a cell statement's liblist when the module was instantiated by another module that was configured by a cell statement.</li>
<li>
Enumerations were not available for use in virtual function formal arguments in classes derived from base class containing the enum.</li>
<li>
Optimization with vopt could produce incorrect vector results when optimizing through continuous assignments containing concatenations of net part selects where the selected nets were themselves driven by continuous assignments of concatenations.</li>
<li>
The $nochange task reported simulatenous data and clock events as violations.  This contradicted the IEEE 1364-2001 specification. </li>
<li>
The array 'shuffle' method now uses the "-sv_seed" value for seeding its random number generator.  This means that the results of 'shuffle' are repeatable.</li>
<li>
Accessing a class property that was directly inherited from a non-parameterized class which had a parameterized class inheritance ancestor could cause incorrect memory locations to be accessed.  A prototypical case would be:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   class base #(int p = 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endclass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    class mid extends base#();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       int x,y;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endclass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    class derived extends mid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endclass<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    derived d = new;  // accessing x or y via d could cause problems.
</code></li>
<li>
Parameters defined using an unsized, unbased literal crashed.
 </li>
<li>
When a child process within a fork-join was killed via the 'process::kill' method, the parent containing the fork-join was never reactivated.</li>
<li>
Incorrect errors could be reported regarding ref argument type mismatches when the  actual argument was a reference into a parameterized class object or a reference through a variable whose type was a type parameter.</li>
<li>
In some cases, error checking was incorrect for automatic tasks and functions whose formals were of class types and whose actuals were of other types in the same inheritance hierarchy.  Incorrect errors could be reported and correct errors could be missed.</li>
<li>
Incorrect errors could be reported if extern methods had formals whose types involved parameterized class types or type parameters.</li>
<li>
Errors were not reported when a "local" class member was accessed in an extended class where the access used a "super." or "this." prefix.</li>
<li>
Ref ports could not be logged if the object the port referenced was already logged.  This was also the case for non-ref register ports if the actual and formal were of the same type and length.</li>
<li>
Segmentation fault occured in vlog when using parameter value of a class instance variable as an array index.</li>
<li>
When a SystemVerilog package was compiled into multiple libraries and vopt was run on a design that referenced the different copies it would cause an error like:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vopt-7) Failed to open data 
file "./work/test_vopt/._lib2_pkg_fast.dt2" in read mode.<br>
** Error: inst2.sv(6): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vtree.c(10680)
</code></li>
<li>
In some cases where parameterized class methods contained references to variables declared outside the class vopt generated an internal error of the form:<br>
<code># ** Error: interr2.sv(78): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgendecl.c(5934)
allocatedOf(decl) && !alias_exprOf(decl)
</code></li>
<li>
vsim incorrectly reported an error when accessing program items from within a class that was declared in a program.
</li>
<li>
The implicit call to $exit() that should occurs after all program initial blocks complete was not occurring after reloading a design checkpoint file or restarting simulation.</li>
<li>
The error produced by nested generate regions produces a more helpful message.
</li>
<li>
The vlog compiler "autoswitches" between Verilog and System Verilog based upon the file suffix such as ".sv" and ".v".
</li>
<li>
For static elements of a class, sometimes accessing a built-in function was resulting in this internal error:
<BR>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vallocate.c(932) dst 
&& src
</code></li>
<li>
Module instantiation using aggregate concat sometimes could cause errors like:
<br>
<code>
** Error: new.v(8): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(7381) targetOf(e)
</code>
<br>or
<br>
<code>
** Error: test2.v(10): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgendecl.c(5936) (var_typeOf(decl) != t_net) || is_atomicOf(decl) || net_cacheOf(decl)
</code></li>
<li>
Starting with the 6.3 release, bitstream casting involving multi-dimensional unpacked arrays sometimes resulted in incorrect output. This worked prior to the 6.3 release. 
</li>
<li>
Packed types were incorrectly compared using "equivalence" rules rather than "matching" rules when used as type parameters for parameterized classes.  This resulted in some incorrect specializations and resulting elaboration errors.</li>
<li>
Cycle delays are now supported in $unit.</li>
<li>
The vsim switch <b>+vlog_retain_old</b> will provide pre-6.3 RETAIN behavior in Verilog modules. Setting the environment variable "MTI_VLOG_RETAIN_OLD" will have the same effect. </li>
<li>
Improvements have been made when reporting errors for empty Verilog statement lists.
</li>
<li>
Optimized Verilog cell functions incorrectly wrt. input of net type supply1, supply0.</li>
<li>
On large designs with very deep data flow dependencies through the design vopt could fail with a message such as:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  # ** Error: (vopt-1975) vopt failed -- received signal 11. 
</code></li>
<li>
System Verilog designs using fork..join_none block containing local variables that are passed to "ref" arguments of a task or function could cause vsim to crash.</li>

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
In prior releases the VHDL compiler allowed a variable of a protected type
to be created prior to declaring the body. This is common if a package is
used to declare the protected type header and a shared variable of that type
is also declared within the package header. The simulation could crash or
generate incorrect results when this happened.  The vcom switch <b>-allowProtectedBeforeBody</b> allows the old behavior but the simulator can still crash or generate incorrect results.</li>
<li>
vsim could crash during elaboration when hanging logic removal optimizations failed to cancel all the descendant statements of a statement that was removed.</li>
<li>
A protected type can be declared in package body and a shared variable of that type that is private to the body of a procedure in that package may also be declared.  In an optimized design, where subprogram inlining occurred, it was possible to crash vsim when calling that procedure.</li>
<li>
Compilation failed when the option <b>-check_synthesis</b> was used and there was an attribute of a design unit used.</li>
<li>
A port of an unconstrained array type, whose mode is not IN, and that has a default expression in its declaration, can be associated only with an actual that has a matching element for every element in the default expression.  The error message related to a violation of this rule has been improved.</li>
<li>
Some "for loops" when iterating beyond a dimension of a multidimensional array signal crashed.
</li>
<li>
An optimization of wait statement representing an edge transition of a boolean signal expressed in a redundant form:<br>
"<code>wait until (bool_clk'event and (bool_clk'last_value = false) and (bool_clk = true));</code>"  caused a crash. </li>
<li>
An optimization of a wait statement for one case of a gated clock in which the gate expression is a boolean could resume the process on the wrong edge.</li>
<li>
vopt crashed when an identifier is overloaded (e.g. defined both as enum and function), and is used inside a process, and if vopt is run with the <b>-check_synthesis</b> option.</li>
<li>
Some clock and latch optimizations using signal arrays would crash.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, a port that was used as the actual for an out mode signal parameter of a procedure was being optimized incorrectly and caused a crash in vsim.</li>
<li>
Multiple uses of the same signal array in a port map caused a crash.</li>
<li>
The number of iterations for a FOR GENERATE could be incorrectly determined to be 0.  This would occur if the design was optimized, the architecture containing the FOR GENERAGE is instantiated multiple times and in at least one case the correct number of iterations 0.</li>
<li>
Some signal arrays passed to record port fields were connected incorrectly which produced incorrect results.
</li>
<li>
Using Generate Index as an index for Index Expression in a generic map caused a crash in 6.3a in Power-Aware mode.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed on some signal arrays driven at lower points in the design hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
This VHDL design crashed in vsim with earlier release (6.3a)</li>

<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The Vital 2000 "vital_timing" package overloaded VitalSetupHoldCheck() procedure (the one with the TestSignal parameter of type std_logic_vector) had what we consider to be a bug in the original VHDL source version, also replicated in our accelerated version of this procedure.  This bug prevented Setup and/or Hold checks from being reported.  In anticipation of the IEEE Vital standard being corrected, this bug has been fixed not only in the VHDL source located at [install_dir]/vhdl_src/vital2000/timing_b_2000.vhd, but also in the accelerated version of the procedure.</li>
<li>
An interconnect annotation from an optimized Verilog cell to a VHDL instance would not report an error if the VHDL instance was not VITAL compliant.  The error reporting is now consistent between optimized and non-optimized.</li>

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
In certain cases when VHDL instantiated a Verilog module in a resource library and the work library contained a VHDL entity with the same name as the instantiated Verilog module, then vopt selected the wrong library name, causing vsim to fail to load the design.</li>
<li>
The Verilog $countdrivers system task was enhanced to work on ports that are at mixed language boundaries.</li>
<li>
VHDL entities instantiated within Verilog crashed under certain circumstances.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>coverage analyze -select attr NAME -eq VALUE</b> command will compare a user-defined attribute of string type using integer or floating point as appropriate (e.g., an attribute whose value is the string "6" can be compared as an int or float.)  This allows user-defined attributes imported from a test plan to be compared intuitively.
</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage attribute</b> command did not work in a vsim simulation however, dataset; "coverage attr" did.  This was inconsistent with coverage view mode, where "attribute" is used and documented.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-codeAll</b> option was added to the <b>coverage save</b> command.</li>
<li>
There was a problem with VHDL condition and expression coverage related to the
handling of VHDL 'H' and 'L' values. Previously, conditions and expressions
automatically converted 'H' and 'L' input values to '1' and '0', respectively. 
This simplified the UDP tables, but could result in incorrect behavior for
circuits that used and tested for 'H' and 'L'. Now, the default behavior is
to NOT convert input values as described. But if you are not using 'H' and 'L'
values, and object to the additional UDP rows that are difficult to cover, you
can do one of the following:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Change your VHDL expressions of the form (a = '1') to (to_x01(a) = '1') or to std_match(a,'1'). These functions will be recognized and used to simplify the UDP tables.
<LI>Set the new modelsim.ini variable "CoverRespectHandL" to 0. This gives the previous behavior.
<LI>Use the option <b>vcom -nocoverrespecthandl</b>.
</UL></li>
<li>
Calculation of toggle coverage was corrected for cases involving a subset of a UCDB.  This affected some invocations of the <b>coverage analyze</b> command reporting toggle coverage; the Test Tracker GUI if toggle coverage was linked to part of a test plan; and the test ranking algorithm if applied to toggle coverage and a subset of the design hierarchy.

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existant on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Attempting to traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an instance or a scope will result in a crash.</li>
<li>
There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.
</ul></li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>restart</b> command will reload the current dataset if the current dataset is not the active simulation ("sim"), in effect acting just like a restart of a simulation.  See the <b>dataset restart</b> command below under "New Features".</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below the product directory.</li>
<li>
The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see <b>vcover report -html</b>).</li>
<li>
Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted.  For example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)" and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.  The conditions under which
name permutation could occur are based on internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly correlated to source descriptions.
</li>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
<br>...
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.
</li>

This release includes the new Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving vopt the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.
</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line
  <ol>
  <li>Added a <b>-verbose</b> option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A <b>-ucdbfilename &lt;file&gt;</b> option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any <b>-format &lt;format&gt;</b> option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The <b>-tagseparators &lt;chars&gt;</b> option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
<li>
If the PATH column value is set to "-" it will be ignored (this is useful for the PATH-per-LINK case where one of the LINK values doesn't need a PATH).
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a "Path" column to direct testplan link item matching to a specific region of the design. In addition, a path may be prepended onto any CoverGroup, CoverPoint or Cross link item.<br>
For CoverPoint, CoverGroup, and Cross link items:<ul>
<li>If the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path information will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option to the tag command and the trailing component of the Link column will be parsed as usual and used to match the cover item. Any path added to the string in the Link column will be ignored.</li>
<li>If the Path column is not used or is left blank, and a path is prepended onto the string in the Link column, the prepended path will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option on the tag command.</li></ul>
For CoverItem, Assertion, or Directive link items:<ul>
<li>If the string in the Link column starts with a path separator character, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option in the tag command and no other tag command option is used.</li>
<li>If the string in the Link column does not start with a path separator (in other words, is not a full path), and the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option and the Link strung is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command and no path is specified.</li></ul>
For all other link item types, the contents of the Path column are ignored.
Note: If the Path column for a given link item is the literal string "-", the Path column is ignored for that link item only.
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports test data record tagging. If the Type column for a given link item is "Test", the contents of the Link column will be used as the value of the <b>-testrecord</b> option on the tag command associated with that link item.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a <b>-stylesheet &lt;file&gt;</b> option ("stylesheet=<file>" in the INI file). This option points to an XSL transformation stylesheet which is applied to the imported XML file prior to extraction.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports XML files generated by Jasper's GamePlan testplan utility. Use the <b>-format GamePlan</b> option. </li>
<li>
Use of the "analog" format within the Wave window has been made easier by adding support for the use of <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> to control waveform scaling (the old method required use of "offset" and "scale").</li>
<li>
<h>Font Changes</h><br>
The way fonts are used and configured in the product has changed.  There are now 5 configurable fonts in the product: menuFont, textFont, fixedFont, treeFont, and footerFont.  These fonts are used by all windows and are customer configurable using the Edit Preferences dialog box.  The previous method of configuring fonts is no longer used and the preference variables will be ignored.  The Source window will continue to use it's own font setting as that window shares the font preferences with other products that use the DesignPad text editor.<br>
For current customers upgrading to 6.3b and later releases that have set up customized font preferences, these preferences will have to be manually configured for the new fonts, otherwise the product will look and behave just the same.</li>
<li>
A change to licensing  for this release eliminates extraneous entries in the license server log file that were the result of an availability check for a license feature.    There used to be a license checkout  line (i.e., OUT) followed by a license checkin line (i.e., IN) with 0 time duration each time the application checked on the availability of a license to decide whether to attempt the actual checkout of the license. </li>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GB.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default &lt;size&gt; unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either KB, MB or GB specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code>
vcd limit 6GB<br>
</code>

or<br>

<code>
vcd limit 400MB
</code></li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.3b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>-nocase</b> option was added to vcd2wlf to convert all identifiers into lower case.</li>
<li>
Language templates were added for System Verilog support and the System Verilog syntax radio button was removed from the Verilog tab in the project compiler settings dialog box. Old projects with files of type Verilog and the System Verilog syntax selected will automatically convert to System Verilog type.
Customers may need to remove the .hte directory from their home directory in order for the new templates to load properly.</li>
<li>
Added the <b>dataset restart</b> command.  This command will unload the specified dataset or current dataset and reloaded the file using the same pathname.  The Wave window contents will be restored after the reload.</li>
<li>
A new HTML report generator (<b>vcover report -html</b>) has been implemented. Among the
new features are:
<ol>
<li>Functional coverage reporting (summary and details),</li>
<li>Added Coverage-by-child table for non-leaf instance and testplan pages,</li>
<li>Added testplan coverage summary to title page,</li>
<li>Improved hierarchical browser (now works on most browsers, including IE7),</li>
<li>Additional options: <b>-debug</b>, <b>-verbose</b>, <b>-nosource</b>,</li>
<li>Removed bogus "No coverage found" message from HTML mode,</li>
<li>Buttons to select All/Covered/Missed details (requires JavaScript), and</li>
<li>CSS stylesheets provided for both screen and print media,</li>
<li>Fallback modes for frame- and/or script-challenged browsers.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
Test traceability is now available for directed tests, identified by test name. Tests contribute 0% coverage that have not yet run (identified in the test plan but not found in any test data record in the current UCDB) or have error status.  Tests contribute 100% coverage that have run successfully.  Separate release notes describe supporting features in "coverage tag" and "Test plan (XML) import".  The <b>coverage unlinked</b> command has a new option <b>-testname</b> to find unlinked tests: i.e., tests that do not appear in any test plan section.  For example:<br>
<code>
coverage unlinked -testname *
</code>
</li>
<li>
Enhanced support for analog format in Wave window. The old mechanism of using "scale" and "offset" has been replaced with a more intuitive way of defining the waveform's data. The new way allows specifying the minimum and maximum data values that should be viewed for a waveform. So for example, if a waveform's data varies between 0.0 and 1.0, then the waveform could be added by using this command:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add wave -min 0 -max 1 -height 100 -analog my_signal
</code>
<br>
Once the waveform has been formatted as analog there is special toolbar available which is accessed by moving the mouse pointer to the left or right extreme of the waveform's row within the Wave window. A variety of operations are available as well as the ability to dynamically resize the waveform row. Also, whenever the toolbar is shown the currently set "min" and "max" levels are shown as well as the waveform's "zero line". Lastly, it is now possible to control if the waveform's drawing is allowed to extend above and/or below its row. When using <b>add wave</b> this would be set with the <b>-clampanalog 0|1</b> option.</li>
<li>
Fork..join_none and non-blocking assignments may now be used within System Verilog functions that are called from initial blocks.</li>
