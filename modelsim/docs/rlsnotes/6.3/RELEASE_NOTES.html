<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3</b>
<ul>
<li>
After hiding all toolbars, the area that holds the toolbars collapsed to just a few pixels.  This area contained the only menu for changing the toolbar visibility, making it difficult to unhide toolbars once they had all been closed.  There is now a toolbars sub menu under the windows pulldown, which is identical to the popup menu.</li>
<li>
There were several issues dealing with window visiblity changes while a window was maximized.  Minimizing the window would not return the GUI to the expected state.  Changing window visiblity will now automatically minimize a maximized window and the resulting window visibility is correct.</li>
<li>
Under certain circumstance the <b>add wave</b> command did not issue an error when no signals were found.  This occurred when the <b>-r</b> (recursive) switch was used.  Now the command will always return an error if no signals are found.</li>
<li>
In an undocked Memory window, if the edit in place box was opened, most of the menu picks resulted in an error if the edit in place box was not closed.</li>
<li>
The WLF file reader now returns an error message if the file appears corrupt rather then exiting the tool with an assertion.</li>
<li>
Better checking for legal dataset name prior to opening or renaming a dataset.  (A legal dataset name must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.)</li>
<li>
Changing the column width within the Locals window collapsed all expanded items.  The expansion state is now retained on a column resize.</li>
<li>
The Visibility column in the Structure window incorrectly specifies limited visibility when using the <b>-novopt</b> option.</li>
<li>
When undocked, commands issued through the profile find toolbar could be applied to the wrong window.  The profile find toolbar now applies the find operation to the correct window.    </li>
<li>
Added the ability to overwrite existing files in the project directory.</li>
<li>
To avoid confusion with "extended VCD" the <b>-map</b> and <b>-nomap</b> options to VCD commands now print "enhanced VCD" in the VCD file header.</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>-printsimstats</b> option was not working.</li>
<li>
Using the CTRL-S shortcut to save new files on Windows did not change the Source window title.</li>
<li>
The GUI crashed in waveform creation of a signed reg signal.</li>
<li>
Expanding a ref struct variable did not expand its value in the Locals window.</li>
<li>
When printing the contents of the the Wave window, the dialog that reports the
progress will incorrectly report the total number of pages. The dialog
will show something like "Printing page 4 of 3". Now the correct number of pages
are printed and the footer of the print out will contain correct information.</li>
<li>
An array instance path in a virtual signal expression failed.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage</b> command accepted multiple <b>-instance</b> options, but only use the last one. This was changed so that an error message is given if more than one <b>-instance</b> option is specified.</li>
<li>
Interface contents were not always visible.</li>
<li>
In the Source window, lines were no longer shown as executable once a source file was edited using an external editor.</li>
<li>
Line numbers were not updating when scrolling using the middle mouse button.</li>
<li>
Code Coverage windows are now updated properly immediately following elaboration.  Changing context is no longer required to refresh the coverage windows.</li>
<li>
Loading a design with code coverage, then, without existing modelsim and loading another design without coverage would produce errors.  Coverage windows were requesting coverage data that did not exist.  Coverage windows are now sensitive to whether the design has code coverage turned on or not.</li>
<li>
Wave window Find Previous Transition and Find Next Transition searches, for searches that required a relatively long time to perform, could crash the front end when another search was attempted while a search was ongoing.  Such searches are now ignored when a search is underway.  Search attempts are also ignored when the active cursor is locked (including the Now cursor).</li>
<li>
Coverage filenames that contained a hyphen ('-') character could not be successfully read using the vsim <b>-viewcov &lt;filename&gt;</b> command.</li>
<li>
On Windows, invoking the File->Save As... menu pick from an undocked Transcript window caused the Main window to be activiated.  Now, the Transcript window stays on top.</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window did not use the namespace portion of object names passed to it.</li>
<li>
A delayed virtual signal could not be logged or added as a trigger to the List window.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3</b>
<ul>
<li>
Array manipulator methods previously produced incorrect errors when used inside class tasks and functions.</li>
<li>
Previously, the simulator did not do type-checking for connections to ports declared as enums. An error message is now printed during elaboration if the actual value is not of the same enum type.
</li>
<li>
The multiplier in a replicate expression was allowed to be non-constant when the inner concat was not a string concat. We now allow the multiplier to be variable only when the inner concat is a string concat.</li>
<li>
There is now a semantic difference for assignment to and from a string variable. Now, we require a cast for assigning a packed or unpacked variable to a string variable. For example:
<code>
<br>bit [0:2] bit_p;
<br>string s;
<br>s = bit_p; // illegal
<br>s = string'(bit_p); // legal
</code></li>
<li>
Pending non-blocking assignments scheduled from a disabled block are no longer canceled unless the module was compiled with <b>-compat</b>. Previously, the non-blocking assignment  would be canceled only if it was not an optimized form. Either behavior is allowed in the IEEE specification, but now the results are predictable and do not rely on the outcome of optimizations.</li>
<li>
A parameter of type 'time' was not being set correctly if the instantiated module had a different timeunit in effect than the module it was instantiated from.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog requirement that "super.new" calls occur first in a constructor was not being enforced.</li>
<li>
An event involving a field within a struct sometimes incorrectly trigger when a different member of that struct changed.</li>
<li>
Gate-level optimized cells with timing checks and more than 32 conditions evaluate conditions incorrectly in some cases.</li>
<li>
Clocking block outputs (output or inout) drive values onto their corresponding signals only when assigned a value in the previous cycle.</li>
<li>
When a case expression type is parameteric, the simulator sometimes gave incorrect output. 
</li>
<li>
Illegal package references using dot separators rather than the double colon were being permitted.  Imported references to parameterized class objects could cause incorrect elaboration time errors.</li>
<li>
An error was not reported for illegal task and function enables when the formal was an enumeration of mode input and the actual was not assignment compatible.</li>
<li>
An instantiation using ".*" connections could incorrectly fail if the instance was in a generate and the ".*" caused a connection to be bound to a module level declaration.</li>
<li>
Pre and post increment and decrement (++/--) operations could fail with an internal error during simulation if the item being operated on was an unpacked array slice.  This now fails with an appropriate error at elaboration time.</li>
<li>
Forcing a parameter from the command line caused a simulator crash.  Such a force now reports an error regarding an invalid target.</li>
<li>
In certain cases, internal compilation errors occurred for classes declared as "class static".</li>
<li>
In certain cases, an internal error occurred in vopt if the design attempted to defparam a specparam.  This is now correctly reported as an error.</li>
<li>
An error was not reported when the design attempted to extend the "process" class from package std.</li>
<li>
Incorrect source information could be reported from assertion system reporting tasks when the assertion occurred in a parameterized class.</li>
<li>
A concatenation produced incorrect results in an optimized design in some cases. Specifically, there were problems with concatenating nets driven by continuous assignments where the RHS of the continuous assignment was wider than the net.</li>
<li>
Clocking blocks now support hierarchical expressions as described in IEEE Std 1800-2005 section 15.4, including interfaces.</li>
<li>
The <b>write timing</b> command now displays path delays and timing check limits that are unadjusted for delay net delays by default.  If it is necessary to see the adjusted values (those used for simulation), use the <b>-simvalues</b> switch.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in certain cases when using $countdrivers.</li>
<li>
In an optimized design, if a parameter was only accessed via the PLI and its value was set by a defparam, in some cases the value of the parameter remained the default initial value.</li>
<li>
If a function was called through a null virtual interface an error message should have been generated but was not. Instead the function continued and produced incorrect results.

Now the simulation stops and generates an error message such as:
<code>
<br># ** Fatal: (vsim-3976) Null instance dereference in task/function call.
<br>#    Time: 0 ns  Iteration: 0  Process: /bad_top/#INITIAL#52 File: test1.sv
<br># Fatal error at test1.sv line 21
</code>
</li>
<li>
vlog did not do type-checking between actual and formal arguments in the case of automatic tasks and functions, such as class methods.
In addition, argument type-checking errors are now more informative and print the task/function name and the name of the formal argument.  For example:
<code>
** Error: test1.sv(16): Arg. 'data' of 'convert':  Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Formatting strings in the $value$plusargs system task did not correctly recognize  leading 0 forms (e.g. %0f).</li>
<li>
Under certain circumstances, the division of a 2-state value by another 2-state value incorrectly resulted in 0 when that result was converted to a 4-state value.</li>
<li>
Added optimizations to the Constraint solver to improve performance. Additional analysis of constraints is used to identify specific optimization opportunities (reducing variable dependencies due to equivalence constraints, characterizing constraint complexity).

NOTE: These optimizations may result in random solutions (values) that are different from the random solutions of prior releases.</li>
<li>
The LRM specifies that unpacked array assignment works from left-to-right, regardless of the index directions of the two arrays.  Previously, the simulator was reversing the assignment if the unpacked arrays were not memories.  Examples of this case are arrays of reals or arrays of unpacked structs:<br>
<code>
typedef struct {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  bit a;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  byte cs;<br>
} structa;<br>
/* Unpacked array of unpacked structs. */<br>
structa chrs [2:0];<br>
structa revd [0:2];<br>
<br>
initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   revd = chrs; // revd[0]=chrs[2], revd[1]=chrs[1], revd[2]=chrs[0]
</code></li>
<li>
The simulator now allows empty parentheses as parameter port lists.
</li>
<li>
In many cases type-checking was not done on default argument values in task and function definitions. For example:
<code>
<br>task automatic myfun(int a[]=3); // Illegal assignment to a dyn. array.
 ...
</code></li>
<li>
vopt crashed while optimizing an array of interfaces where the interface contained a clocking block accessed through a modport.</li>
<li>
In certain situations, such as passing an element to a queue method, we were not catching type-errors. These errors are now caught at during simulation. For example:<br>
<code>
module badqueue1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  int q[$];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  int a[1:0];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; initial q.insert(0, a);  // Error, since 'a' should be an int.<br>
endmodule
</code></li>
<li>
Hierarchical references to variables declared within a task or function in a package or $unit scope caused an internal error in vlog and vopt.</li>
<li>
When simulating SystemVerilog code compiled with the <b>-incr</b> option, the simulation  sometimes crashed with the error message:<br>
<code>
INTERNAL ERROR: export_lookup() failed.
</code>
</li>
<li>
When the destination type of a bit stream cast contained more than one dynamic array, the simulator incorrectly resized the last dynamic array instead of the first.</li>
<li>
When the destination type of a bit stream cast is dynamic and the source is a null dynamic array or queue, the simulator sometimes didn't resize the destination to zero size.</li>
<li>
In some cases, the simulator would not catch an illegal assignment to a virtual interface.  This happened when an externally-referenced interface instance was passed to a class method, where the class was parameterized. This resulted in a crash or hang during elaboration or runtime in some cases.
<br>
These errors are now caught and reported as "Illegal assignment".  This error message will be improved in a future release.
</li>
<li>
Indexed selects into arrays of SystemVerilog classes or structs could use an incorrect index value if the type of the index is parameter dependent and if a subsequent field or member select was applied to the indexed select.  Such selects would be of the general form "a[obj.idx].method()".
</li>
<li>
Enum declarations inside tasks or functions could cause fatal errors, particularly within the context of a parameterized class.  Enum declarations that were dependent on module parameter values or other enum declarations could result in incorrect enum values being used.</li>
<li>
A call to a predefined method (such as get_inst_coverage) in the context of a $display or similar system task could cause a fatal error if the enable did not have parentheses for the enable.  Since system tasks and functions permit
scopes as arguments, we cannot treat such a reference as an enable.  Since predefined methods aren't valid as a system routine scope argument, such a reference is not valid at all.  An error is now produced for such invalid uses of a predefined method.</li>
<li>
Using by-name association for a class constructor (new) of a parameterized class type could result in a fatal error at simulation time.</li>
<li>
Using a hierarchical reference to a parameter as a port connection in a module instantiation could result in an incorrect elaboration error of the form:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ** Fatal: (vsim-3986) Unhandled port connection.
</code></li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc</b> option did not allow a negative index. For example <b>+acc=+/top/inst[-1]</b> was not allowed.
</li>
<li>
Assigning an 'assignment pattern' to a packed struct, where elements of the struct were enums, produced incorrect results.
<p>
<br>Example (where Y1 is a packed structure):
<br>Y1 = '{opcode: opc, ra: A };  // Y1 did not get the assigned value.
</li>
<li>
Referencing an imported typedef in a package where the typedef is defined to be a parameterized class specialization could result in compile failures.</li>
<li>
When using "ref" argument passing to tasks and functions where the type
of the "ref" argument was a type parameter or parameterized class, accesses to the formal could be incorrect and cause incorrect results or fatal errors.</li>
<li>
In certain cases where the bounds are non-constant, a continuous assignment of a part-select did not trigger properly.  For example:
<code>
<br>parameter porta_addr_size = f_width2addr(porta_width);
<br>input [porta_addr_size-1:0] addra;
<br>wire    [8:0]              porta_row_addr;
<br>assign porta_row_addr      = addra[(porta_addr_size - 1) -: 9];
</code>
</li>
<li>
Error messages associated with objects located in $unit would report the incorrect file name.</li>
<li>
A default skew containing both edge and time delay values would cause a crash if the clocking block contained no signals.</li>
<li>
The <b>-vlog95compat</b> switch no longer allows comma separated event lists.</li>
<li>
In some cases, initializing a static variable inside a task in SystemVerilog code caused the compiler to generate an internal error message. An example is when the initial value was a time literal such as "0ns".
</li>
<li>
An if-statement branch within an always block failed to execute in some cases when optimized in conjunction with a similar always block having a similar if-statement having an empty begin-end block in one of its branches.</li>
<li>
When compiling SystemVerilog source with the <b>-incr</b> option the compiler was not recompiling modules when imported packages were modified.</li>
<li>
Event control expressions containing logical operators such as "@(a && b)" or "@(a || b)" caused an internal compiler error when used inside an automatic task.</li>
<li>
When using the <b>vopt +acc</b> option on SystemVerilog packages, the generated code sometimes did not permit breakpoints on calls to tasks and functions in the package.</li>
<li>
Bidirectional pass switches had not been included in creating extended VCD files.  </li>
<li>
The ternary operator produced incorrect results in some cases if the condition operand was a bitwise inversion of a vector result.</li>
<li>
An indexed part-select of a vector net in a port connection list resulted in an inappropriate error message indicating that the "bounds are reversed" in an optimized design where the connected module was inlined.</li>
<li>
The sensitivity list implied for @* failed to include variables referenced in unreachable statements or ineffectual expressions due to constant propagation optimizations.</li>
<li>
There was a problem where concatenation of duplicate 2-state values could produce the wrong result. For example:<br>
<code>
{bval[63:0],bval[63:0]}
</code></li>
<li>
Conditional pathdelay selection could be incorrect particularly when multiple sequential cells are connected to a common clock net.</li>
<li>
Gate-level models with buffered delayed nets did not function correctly with +delayed_timing_checks.</li>
<li>
The parser would not correctly handle block comments containing "/*" as in  /*/AUTOWIRE/*/.</li>
<li>
Signals that are part of an interface instantiated as a vector could not be individually logged or added to a Wave window.
</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog clocking blocks are compliant with Mantis Item #890. </li>
<li>
In systemverilog, the liblist clause of an instance in a config is now being inherited hierarchically downward to all entities.  This resolution will take place before using libraries specified in the -L switch.</li>

<li>
Under some circumstances, a VPI iteration for vpiLoad on a vpiNet or vpiNetBit handle looped endlessly.</li>
<li>
The acc_fetch_value and acc_set_value routines failed on System Verilog 2-state variable types in the accVectorVal format mode.</li>

<li>
The simulator now indexes the argument to the resolution function based on the arugment's type. It no longer automatically assumes the range to begin at zero.
</li>
<li>
A procedure with an array type out or inout mode signal parameter had sometimes caused a crash because of two conflicting optimizations.</li>
<li>
Elaboration differences could occur when the simulation was run with <b>-vopt</b> or -<b>novopt</b>. In some cases, the VHDL generated incorrect default binding at elaboration time to Verilog modules compiled with <b>-93</b> supplied to the vlog command when vsim had the <b>-novopt</b> option set. The incorrect default binding would bind the component instead if leaving it unbound or reporting an error.</li>
<li>
When using a location map, refreshing a design caused pathnames to be incorrectly processed. The result was visible in the simulator when viewing source files failed because of invalid pathnames to the source files.</li>
<li>
When using the <b>-check_synthesis</b> option, clock processes where the clock was an index expression incorrectly generated warnings.</li>
<li>
Access type variables initialized with new in a protected type body now work correctly.
</li>
<li>
When a package declaration contained a subprogram declaration along with an alias to that subprogram, and when another design unit called the subprogram using an expanded name whose suffix was the alias name, vopt would erroneously report that the subprogram body for the subprogram was missing.</li>
<li>
Use of signal_force() in a VHDL design could cause the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
When run repeatedly on a top-level design unit, if the hierarchy contained a VHDL design unit with at least 2 different specializations (different generic values inferred for instantiations of the same architecture), vopt generated code for some of the specialized design units, and for all design units at higher levels of the design. vopt should have determined that none of the design units had been recompiled, and therefore no code generation was needed.</li>
<li>
vcom and vopt crashed when encountering a slice expression in the index_specification of a for generate_statement_label in a block_specification within a configuration declaration.</li>

SystemC stdout is suppressed when vopt is running.  This means that messages from cout, printf and fprintf to stdout will not be displayed on the screen when vopt is running. Anything printed on stderr will still be displayed. Use the vopt option <b>-enablescstdout</b> to enable stdout.  </li>
<li>
vsim crashed when a transaction stream was created in the start_of_simulation() callback of the parent module. </li>
<li>
An input or inout port cannot be forced if the port has values coming into
it from a higher level.  Forcing such an input or inout should result in
an error.  For lower level SystemC, this condition was not being caught.
Now such a case correctly results in an error.</li>
<li>
A force on a SystemC signal did not always propagate correctly through inputs or IOs to instantiated Verilog or VHDL below.</li>
<li>
The <b>noforce</b> command on a SystemC signal caused a crash if the signal was not being forced.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Multiple vopt generated Verilog and VHDL design units are now merged before 
saving into a UCDB file. </li>
<li>
The <b>toggle report</b> command has changed in the following way in vsim and viewcov mode. The same behavior is true for vcover with the <b>-toggles</b> option.
<UL>
<LI> <b>-instance</b> and <b>-recursive</b> options were added to show toggles under the given instance path.</LI>
<LI> <b>-select &lt;inputs|outputs|inouts|ports|internals&gt;</b> option was added to filter input, output, inout, all ports, and internal signals.</LI>
<LI> <b>-unique</b> option was removed, reported toggles are always unique now.</LI>
</UL>
     </li>
<li>
Code coverage was not handled correctly in generate blocks. Now code coverage is on and only on in generate blocks that actually get elaborated. The <b>-coverGenerate</b> option is no longer needed. If you want to revert to the old behavior of code coverage being off in generate blocks, use the <b>-nocoverGenerate</b> option to vcom, vlog or vopt.</li>
<li>
When running with toggle coverage, there was a memory leak that occurred whenever the coverage data was updated. This leak could be quite large when processing a group of <b>exclude</b> commands. In extreme cases this leak exhausted memory and caused the simulator to exit or crash.</li>
<li>
If expression and statement coverage are enabled, in some cases the missing expression coverage tab displayed nothing even though expressions were not completely covered.  This only occurred when you viewed coverage data by instance, not by file.</li>
<li>
When multiple files were compiled on the same vcom or vlog command line and source code coverage pragmas were used the pragmas sometimes got carried over from one file to another when they shouldn't have been. Now if vlog <b>-mfcu</b> is specified, the pragmas will get carried over, but otherwise they will not.</li>
<li>
The <b>-out</b> option was added to the <b>vcover merge</b> command to specify the output filename explicitly. </li>
<li>
Regular expression matching didn't work in fcover report and coverage report
commands.</li>
<li>
A new report option named <b>-subscopes</b> was added to the coverage and vcover report commands. This option prints code coverage data from generate blocks in byinstance report mode.</li>
<li>
The command <b>coverage testnames</b> or <b>vcover testnames</b> lists all test names that have been included in a given UCDB file.  (A merged UCDB file will have multiple test names, that could be used with the <b>coverage analyze</b> command.)  Test names can be established by the user before saving a UCDB file with the command <b>coverage attr -test mytestname</b>; otherwise by default the test name is the same as the basename of the UCDB file.
</li>
<li>
Multiple <b>-instance</b>, -<b>du</b>, and <b>-source</b> options are now supported in coverage and vcover report commands to specify multiple instance, design unit, and source file names in a single command.</li>
<li>
Arguments to the <b>coverage clear</b> command have changed. The new usage is:
<ul>coverage clear [-assert] [-cvg] [-code &lt;bcefst&gt;] [-codeAll]<br>
               [-excluded [-user|-pragma]] [-directive] [-du &lt;name&gt;]<br>
               [-instance &lt;path&gt;] [-match &lt;string&gt;] [[-path] &lt;obj&gt;+]<br>
               [-recursive]</ul></li>
<li>
Unreadable UCDB files were created if vsim command line has any quoted newline character.</li>
<li>
Excluded toggle bits were displaying in report.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.3</b>
<ul>
<li>
Changed the following things in the dpiheader generated during vsim:<br>
<UL>
<LI>unsigned int64_t -> uint64_t
<LI>short int -> short 
<LI>recognition of unsigned for char
</UL></li>
<li>
If a module port list contained "input logic" (or "output logic", "input integer", etc) then that input (or output) was not handled correctly by certain commands such as <b>find signals</b> or <b>vcd add</b> if the commands included the options <b>-in</b> or <b>-out</b>.</li>
<li>
When optimizing designs with vopt, the resultant output could sometimes be susceptible to external changes to the file system environment (e.g. changing the working directory, moving or deleting libraries, re-mapping libraries, etc.).  This has been made more robust.</li>
<li>
We support the changes to the IEEE P1800 LRM section 20.8 regarding virtual interfaces by now allowing an assignment of a virtual interface with no selected modport to a virtual interface that has a modport in its definition.
</li>
<li>
Calls to the signal_release() VHDL procedure or $signal_release() Verilog system task could leak memory if no prior call to signal_force() or $signal_force() were made on the specific destination object.</li>
<li>
If an invalid type of string or pointer was specified when recording a transaction attribute, a warning was issued and no attribute is recorded.  This applies to both the SCV and SystemVerilog transaction recording interfaces.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog transaction recording interface does a much better job of handling expressions, system function return values, class members, etc. as parameters to it's system task and system function calls and of properly handling and giving warning messages for invalid parameters.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog transaction recording interface system function $create_transaction_stream() now creates the stream in the region from which the call is made.  Note:  since the stream is created at simulation time, if the region is optimized away, the stream will be created in a higher level region.  If this is not the desired behavior, the user needs to take care to prevent optimization of the region containing the $create_transaction_stream() call.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existant on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.

<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3</b>
<ul>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the vcd dumpports command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
<br>...
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.

This release includes the new Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
Turning on code coverage will now turn off fewer simulator optimizations. This
will result in faster simulations with code coverage on. But you will notice
some differences in code coverage data because of various optimizations. For
instance, optimizations that prevent invoking of always blocks unless the 
data changes in addition to the clock, will result in reduced hit counts for
statements within those blocks. In addition, VHDL processes that are recognized
as clocked flip flops may have confusing numbers in the IF branch coverage. 
The level of optimization with code coverage is now controlled by the <b>CoverOpt</b> modelsim.ini variable or an additional character allowed in 
the <b>-cover</b> option to <b>vcom</b>, <b>vlog</b> or <b>vopt</b>. This is
a digit from 1 to 4, with the following meanings (the default is 2):<p>
1 -- Turn off all optimizations that affect coverage reports.<p>
2 -- Allow optimizations that allow large performance improvements
by invoking sequential processes only when the data changes. Allow VHDL FF
recognition. 
This may make major reductions in coverage counts.<p>
3 -- In addition, allow optimizations that may change expressions or
remove some statements. Allow constant propagation. Allow VHDL
subprogram inlining.<p>
4 -- In addition, allow optimizations that may remove major regions of
code by changing assignments to built-ins or removing unused
signals. Change Verilog gates to continuous assignments.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving <b>vopt</b> the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line

  <li>Added a "-verbose" option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A "-ucdbfilename <file>" option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any "-format <format>" option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the confuguration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The "-tagseparators <chars>" option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.3</b>
<ul>
<li>
"modport expressions" as described in Section 20.4.4 of the IEEE P1800 LRM are now supported. For example:<br>
<code>
interface iface21_iface;<br>
bit [7:0] req = 8'b10110001;<br>
reg [1:0] x;<br>
reg [2:0] y;<br>
modport client(input .high(req[7:4]), output .low(req[3:0]), output .c({x,y}));
</code></li>
<li>
The "type operator" as described in Section 6.10 of the IEEE P1800 LRM is now supported.</li>
<li>
IEEE P1800 LRM section 10.4.1.1, "Pattern matching in case statements", has been implemented.</li>
<li>
The Verilog compiler now supports the use of the 'var' keyword in port declarations:
<br>
<code>
module top(input var integer a);
<br>
</code>
However, the rules in IEEE P1800 Section 19.8 which specify that omitting the 'var' keyword causes the port to default to a net are not implemented yet.</li>
<li>
IEEE P1800 LRM section 10.4.1.2, "Pattern matching in if statements", and section 10.4.1.3, "Pattern matching in conditional expressions", have been implemented. </li>
<li>
Support for arrays of events is provided in this release.  Note that we support the construct "->evarr[0]", the syntax for which is being added to the IEEE P1800 LRM.</li>
<li>
We now support "assignment patterns" as port-actuals, although this is currently restricted to input ports.  For example:<br>
<code>
module ports10;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   int c1 = 2, c0 = 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ports10_low u1('{1, 0}, '{c1, c0});<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   initial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      #10 c1 = 5;<br>
endmodule<br>

module ports10_low (input bit baa [1:0], int c [1:0]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   always_comb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      $display("%0t: baa = {%b, %b}", $realtime, baa[1], baa[0]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   always_comb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      $display("%0t: c = {%0d, %0d}", $realtime, c[1], c[0]);<br>
endmodule
</code>
</li>
<li>
The command <b>mem search</b> can handle regular expressions as a search pattern.  This command takes options <b>-glob &lt;pattern&gt;</b> and <b>-regexp &lt;pattern&gt;</b>. In the case of the <b>-glob</b> option, the pattern is treated as a glob pattern and with the <b>-regexp</b> option, the pattern is treated as a regular expression.  The option <b>-pattern</b> is deprecated.</li>
<li>
Arrays of real/shortreal and float can be viewed as memories.</li>
<li>
Passing arguments as 'const ref' to a function or task is supported now.</li>
<li>
In the PE version, a compile time warning is given for SystemVerilog testbench features detected (that are not supported in PE).  For example: coverage, assertion and randomization.</li>
<li>
The following styles are now supported for FSM Recognition and FSM Coverage.
<ul> 
<li> FSMs using when-else statement. 
<li> FSMs using multiple if-else statement.
<li> FSMs using multiple case statement.
<li> FSMs using mixed if-else and case statement.
<li> FSMs defined using one-hot/one-cold style. 
<li> FSMs using current/next state variable as VHDL record or SV struct field. Nested structures are not supported. 
<li> FSMs using current/next state variable as VHDL index expression.
<li> FSMs using any integral SystemVerilog types like logic, int, bit_vector, enum, packed struct etc. Typedefs of these types are also supported.
<li> Verilog FSMs having state variable assignment to 'x (unknown) value in case statement. This feature is supported with the option <b>-fsmxassign</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The following RTL pragmas are now supported to turn on/off code coverage:
<ul>
<li> pragma synthesis_off
<li> pragma synthesis_on
<li> pragma translate_off
<li> pragma translate_on
<li> vnavigatoroff
<li> vnavigatoron
<li> vhdlcoveroff
<li> vhdlcoveron
</ul>

The 'pragma' keyword in the above pragmas can also be replaced with 'synopsys'/'mentor'/'synthesis'.
</li>
<li>
The <b>add wave</b> command supports the new switch <b>-position &lt;location&gt;</b> to allow better control when adding signals to the Wave window.  Values of &lt;location&gt; are: top, bottom, end, before, after, above, below, or an integer position.  Please see the Reference Manual for detailed usage.</li>
<li>
When a port actual's type is not compatible with the port in a module or interface instantiation, we now print a detailed message indicating the cause of the mismatch.  In addition, we also do full type-checking on net-type ports, which we were not doing previously.
<br>
Examples of error messages:
<br>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-3906) src/array8/test.sv(9): Connection type is incompatible with port (data):  Array ranges [3:0] & [1:0] have different lengths.
<br>
# ** Error: (vsim-3906) src/array8/test.sv(42): Connection type is incompatible with port (data):  Array elems. must both be signed or unsigned.
</code>
</li>
<li>
From IEEE 1800-2005 Section 23.4: `begin_keywords and `end_keywords are supported.
</li>
<li>
The new vsim switch <b>-wlfsimcachesize</b> and associated modelsim.ini variable WLFSimCacheSize have been implemented to complement <b>-wlfcachesize</b> and WLFCacheSize.  The new switch and variable specifically set the size of the WLF reader cache for the simulation dataset only.  This makes it easier to set different sizes for the WLF reader cache used during simulation and those used during post-simulation debug.  If <b>-wlfsimcachesize</b> nor WLFSimCacheSize are specified, the <b>-wlfcachesize</b> or WLFCacheSize settings will be used.</li>
<li>
Logging is now multithreaded on systems that support it. Multithreaded logging is available on Linux and Solaris systems with more than one processor. Multithreaded logging will be used by default on systems where it is available and can be controlled by the vsim options <b>-wlfnothreads</b> and <b>-wlfthreads</b> or the modelsim.ini variable WLFUseThreads. 
<br>
In order to support multithreading, ModelSim executables on the Linux and Solaris platforms are linked with the pthreads library, which may cause problems with gdb. If a 32-bit gdb is invoked on an executable linked with pthreads and running on a system with a 64-bit kernel, gdb may fail to initialize with a message about failing to load a thread debugging library. This is a problem with gdb. The solution is to use a 64-bit gdb executable. The 32-bit Linux distribution of the simulator includes a 64-bit gdb called gdb64 for this purpose. Also, on most Linux distributons, the version of gdb in /usr/bin matches the kernel architecture, so using /usr/bin/gdb should work correctly.</li>
<li>
Added the new coverage CLI command <b>coverage attribute</b>, which replaces the command <b>coverage testattr</b>. <b>coverage attribute</b> works on three types of objects: test, global and user.  You can add, delete or display attributes.
<br>
For test objects, <b>coverage attribute</b> has the same functionality as <b>coverage testattr</b> in did 6.2, except that new test records will no longer be created if the testname does not match what is in the database.  This command continues to work in vsim, vcover and viewcov modes.
<br>
For the global UCDB object, this command allows you to set and display UCDB-wide attributes in viewcov mode only.  These are general-purpose (arbitrary) attributes associated not with a particular object or scope in the database, but associated with the database itself.
<br>
For user objects (design or instance object(s)), this command allows you to set or display attributes associated with the specified object(s) in viewcov mode only.
</li>
<li>
Support for the following features was added:
<br>- hierarchical identifiers
<br>- array variables declared in a package using scope resolution operators
<br>- array members of a struct or union or class as array variables in foreach statements
<br>NOTE: The foreach constraint does not yet support these types of array variables.</li>
<li>
Streaming Operators (pack/unpack) {'<<' and '>>'} are now supported.</li>
<li>
At a C breakpoint, the Locals window will display automatic local variables and their value in the current C/C++ function scope.</li>
<li>
Added the new coverage CLI command <b>coverage goal</b>, which allows you to set or display UCDB-wide coverage goals for coverage types, such as assertions, covergroups, coverpoints, cover directives, code coverages, SystemC and 0-In. There is also the ability to set individual goals for any coverage item with <b>-path</b> or <b>-du</b>, or test plan items with <b>-plansection</b>; these new flags do not combine with the coverage type flags.  Covergroup goal parameters, for example, could be set with this last feature.
</li>
<li>
The Verilog preprocessor supports C-style `__FILE__ and `__LINE__ macros.
</li>
<li>
Supported .triggered propery for events.</li>
<li>
When a sub-class does not override all virtual methods of the super-class, we now print a detailed message indicating the methods that are not overridden.
<br>
Examples of error messages:
<br>
** Error: ../src/Sec11_Classes/Abstract_class/bad_virtual11.sv(7): Sub-class 'child' does not override all virtual methods of abstract superclass 'base'.                                                                                                                           <br>** Error: ../src/Sec11_Classes/Abstract_class/bad_virtual11.sv(7): Sub-class 'child' does not override virtual method 'get' of abstract superclass 'base'.                                                                                                                          <br>** Error: ../src/Sec11_Classes/Abstract_class/bad_virtual11.sv(7): Sub-class 'child' does not override virtual method 'set' of abstract superclass 'base'.</li>
<li>
<b>+notimingchecks</b> will not set the Generic TimingChecksOn to FALSE on all
level0 and level1 VHDL Vital Models.  Generics with the name TimingChecksOn on
non-Vital models are unaffected.  Additionally, on Vital models the generic
TimingChecksOn is not fixed by vopt unless explicitly set by the use of <b>-G</b> or <b>+notimingchecks</b> on the vopt command line.</li>
<li>
Increased GateLevel optimization capacity to accept cells with I/O path and Timing check conditions greater in number than the previous maximum of 32.  The new limit is 254. Because of possible effects to state table size, this value can be restricted by using the <b>+num_opt_cell_conds+&lt;num&gt;</b> command line argument to vlog.</li>
<li>
The new command <b>typespec</b> has been added to query the class names and class relationships of SystemVerilog classes:<br>
Syntax:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;typespec [-isa &lt;value&gt;][-class &lt;value&gt;][-exact][-regexp][-ancestry][-ident &lt;value&gt;] &lt;pattern&gt;
</code>
<br>
Arguments:<br>
<UL>
<LI>-isa &lt;value&gt;<br> Returns classes derived from given &lt;value&gt;.
<LI>-class &lt;value&gt;<br> Returns specialized classes of the given &lt;value&gt;.
<LI>-exact<br> Returns results that match &lt;pattern&gt; exactly.
<LI>-regexp<br> Specifies that all &lt;values&gt; should be treated as regular expressions.
<LI>-ancestry<br> Returns the ancestry for classes matching the criteria.
<LI>-indent &lt;value&gt;<br> Prefixes the results with the given &lt;value&gt;.
<LI>&lt;pattern&gt;<br>The pattern you are querying for.
<LI>-help<br> Prints this message.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
The simulator is now integrated with <b>SystemC OSCI release 05 June, 2006 beta release of 2.2</b>. Here is a list of known incompatibilities between this release and 2.1.v1: <br>

<ul>
<li> Lambda expressions, and the functions and methods associated with them, have been removed to comply with the SystemC standard.

<ul>
<li> The delayed() method has been removed from the signal and port classes that took bool or sc_logic templates. The delayed() method was used to generate lambda expressions and so is obsolete.

<li> The watching() function has been removed. The major use of the watching() function was to provide reset semantics for SC_CTHREAD instances. This is accomplished in SystemC 2.2.0 by using the reset_signal_is() method of the sc_module class.

<li> The wait_until() function has been removed. Calls to wait_until() can be replaced by a do-while loop. For example, the following wait_until() call: <br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    wait_until( valid.delayed() == true ); <br>
</code>
        can be replace it with: <br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    do { wait(); } while ( !(valid == true) ); <br>
</code>
</ul>

<li>The check for multiple writers of a signal is off by default. This can be turned on by setting the ScEnableScSignalWriteCheck modelsim.ini variable to "1". When turned on if two separate processes write to a signal an error will be reported. 

<li>There are now warning messages for the many of the deprecated features in Annex C of the IEEE 1666 SystemC Language Reference Manual.  These messages are turned off by default.  They can be turned on by setting the ScShowIeeeDeprecationWarnings modelsim.ini variable to "1".

<li>The signature for the find_event() virutal method in sc_event_finder has changed. An additional optional sc_interface pointer has been added as an argument. So the signature is now: <br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual sc_event& find_event( sc_interface* p = 0 ) const; <br>
</code>
The additional argument is used to specify the interface to return the sc_event instance for when using multi-interface ports.

<li>The function for setting the time unit associated with a trace file has changed. It now has the signature: <br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void set_time_unit( double v, sc_time_unit tu )<br>
</code>
    rather than:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void set_time_unit( int exponent10_seconds )<br>
</code>

<li>Three methods were removed from sc_simcontext that were previously used to register processes:<br>
<ul>
<li>register_cthread_process()
<li>register_method_process()
<li>register_thread_process()
</ul>
These are no longer called, since you cannot create a process without calling one of the three new create_XXXX_process methods.


<li>The << operators for process handles have been removed from the sc_sensitive, sc_sensitive_neg, and sc_sensitive_pos classes:<br>
<ul>
<li>operator << ( sc_cthread_handle )
<li>operator << ( sc_module_handle )
<li>operator << ( sc_thread_handle )
</ul>
These are no longer needed since one can use an sc_process_handle instance to set the process.

</ul></li>
<li>
Added support for SystemC/SystemVerilog types across the SystemC-SystemVerilog mixed language boundary:<br>

The following types are supported:<br>
<ul>
<li>SystemC instantiating SystemVerilog: bit, logic, reg, bit vector, wire, integer, integer unsigned, int, shortint, longint, int unsigned, shortint unsigned, longint unsigned, byte, byte unsigned, packed structures, unpacked structures, packed unions, enum, nested structures (packed and unpacked), nested unions (only packed unions), real and shortreal.
<br>
<li>SystemVerilog Instantiating SystemC: bool, sc_bit, sc_logic, sc_bv, sc_lv, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long, sc_int/sc_signed, sc_uint/sc_unsigned, sc_bigint, sc_biguint, char, unsigned char, struct, union, enum, nested structures, nested unions, float and double.
</ul>
Please refer to the User's Manual for more details on the type-mapping.
</li>
<li>
scgenmod has been enhanced to take the following SystemVerilog types as input:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Basic types: bit, logic, reg, bit vector, wire, integer, integer unsigned, int, shortint, longint, int unsigned, shortint unsigned, longint unsigned, byte and byte unsigned.
<LI>Complex types: packed structures, unpacked structures, packed unions and enum.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
Designers using VHDL-AMS sometimes want to use the simulator to test
purely digital parts of their model. This can be difficult because of
differences in package STANDARD between VHDL-AMS and digital VHDL. In
particular, the VHDL-AMS standard package contains a declaration of a
REAL_VECTOR type which is not present in the digital VHDL package.  To
resolve this, the simulator now has a feature to modify package STANDARD
to be more compatible with the AMS package.<br>

If the vcom command line contains the option <b>-amsstd</b> or the
modelsim.ini file contains the setting:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    AmsStandard = 1<br>
</code>
then the declaration of REAL_VECTOR will be added to the simulator's
STANDARD package.<br> 

This feature can be explicitly disabled if the vcom command line contains
the option <b>-noamsstd</b> or the modelsim.ini file contains the setting<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    AmsStandard = 0<br>
</code>
If neither <b>-amsstd</b> nor -<b>noamsstd</b> is supplied on the command
line and the AmsStandard variable is not set in the modelsim.ini file,
then the compatibility feature is enabled if the environment
variable MGC_AMS_HOME is set.

</li>
<li>
A project option was added that allows the user to specify if source files should be closed when a project is closed. The default is to close them.</li>
<li>
More VHDL200X features are now supported. For details see 
the following file in the install directory:<br>
modeltech/docs/technotes/vhdl200x.note</li>
<li>
Hierarchical references from the bound scope using SystemVerilog bind into the design scope is now supported.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog bind, in the vopt flow, is now fully compatible with the IEEE P1800 LRM. In the incremental flow, the 6.2 restriction on actual expressions still exists.
<br>
If the target of bind is a VHDL design unit or an instance of a VHDL design unit, only the following types of actual expressions are supported in the vopt flow:
<br>
<ul>
<li> bitwise binary expressions using operators &, |, ~, ^ and ^~.
<li> concatenation expression.
<li> bit select and part select expressions.
<li> any variable/constant visible in the target scope including those defined in packages can be used in an actual expression.
</ul></li>
<li>
SystemC sc_main() is now supported as a top-level module.  To run a SystemC design with sc_main(), simply invoke vsim with sc_main as the top-level module. For example:<br>
<code>
vsim -c sc_main
</code></li>
<li>
The Verilog compiler allows the command line switch <b>-mixedansiports</b> which permits partial port redeclarations.</li>
<li>
Support for SystemC dynamic module array was added. An example of using dynamic module array is given below:
<br>
<code>
module **mod_inst;<br>
mod_inst = new module*[2];<br>
mod_inst[0] = new module("mod_inst[0]");<br>
mod_inst[1] = new module("mod_inst[1]");<br>
</code>
However there is one limitation on this support. The instances of these modules have to be named exactly same as the corresponding C++ variables, such as "mod_inst[0]" and "mod_inst[1]" in the case of above example.
</li>
<li>
We now support the use of replication assignment patterns for structs, as in:
<br>
<code>
struct {int X,Y,Z;} XYZ = '{3{1}};<br>
</code>
A limitation we impose is that all elements of the struct must have equivalent types.</li>
<li>
Multiple SystemVerilog libraries support for SystemC DPI was added. At sccom link phase, all the SystemVerilog libraries that contain the SystemC DPI routine referrences should be provided to sccom via the <b>-dpilib</b> switch:
<br>
<code>
sccom -link -dpilib &lt;libname&gt; [-dpilib &lt;libname&gt;]<br>
</code>
Refer to Section "SystemC Procedural Interface to SystemVerilog" in the User's Manual for a more detailed description.
</li>
<li>
A new vlog switch, <b>-scdpiheader &lt;filename&gt;</b>, is added for SystemC DPI users. This switch specifies the name of SystemC DPI function prototype header file automatically generated from the current compilation. The default filename is sc_dpiheader.h when no such switch is provided.
<br>
Refer to Section "SystemC Procedural Interface to SystemVerilog" in User's Manual for a more detailed description.
</li>
<li>
The "local" and "protected" qualifiers on class items are now enforced.</li>
<li>
Type inheritance is now supported when extending a parameterized class.</li>
<li>
A warning is now reported when a SystemVerilog mailbox is created with a negative size and the mailbox is treated as being of size 0.  Previously this was silently treated as a size of 0.</li>
<li>
Verification Management Features
<ul>
<li> <b>Test Plan Import</b> is accessed from the File / Import / Test Plan menu or from the right-mouse button pop-up of the Test Browser GUI.  This can convert test plan XML to a UCDB file for test traceability analysis.  There are specific formatting requirements for specifying coverage associated with parts of the test plan; consult the <b>xml2ucdb</b> documentation.
<li> The <b>Verification Management Tracker</b> GUI is used for test traceability analysis, per-test coverage analysis, and other analysis.  This GUI requires invoking vsim -viewcov on a merged file containing test plan and test results, with test plan items linked to coverage.  This merged file must be loaded with vsim -viewcov.  The linking of test plan items to coverage can occur automatically during merge if the test plan UCDB is generated by <b>xml2ucdb</b> (invoked by the Test Plan Import facility.)  This linking can also be done manually with the <b>coverage tag</b> command.
<li> The <b>Test-Associated Merge</b> is the default merge algorithm.  This merge algorithm associates coverage items with the test(s) that covered them.  This allows more sophisticated analysis of results per-test with the <b>coverage analyze</b> command.  The previous merge algorithm is available with <b>vcover merge -totals</b>.
<li> <b>Test Ranking</b>: rank most effective tests by using the <b>vcover ranktest</b> command with various parameters and UCDB files as input.  Creates an output file that can be loaded into the <b>Test Management Browser</b>.  If a UCDB file is loaded into memory with vsim -viewcov, the ranking algorithm can be applied to parts of a test plan as well as parts of the design or its coverage.
<li> <b>Verification Management Browser</b>: accessed with <b>View / Verification Management / Browser</b> from the ModelSim/Questa GUI.  This can display summary information for merged test results in a UCDB, ranking files, and original test results in UCDBs.  It has a feature for user-customizable column headings.  Facilities are available for re-running tests or general verification set-up, generating code coverage and test plan HTML reports (see documentation for <b>ucdb2html</b>), and executing merges and test ranking.
<li> <b>coverage tag</b> is a vsim -viewcov mode command for making associations between coverage items and test plan sections.
<li> <b>coverage analyze</b> is a vsim -viewcov mode command used to make coverage queries in context of test plans or the design hierarchy.  It offers the following queries:
<ul>
<li> Report total coverage in a test plan or design hierarchy.
<li> Report a summary per coverage category in a test plan or design hierarchy.
<li> With the test-associated merge, report coverage for specified tests only.
<li> With the test-associated merge, report which test offered most, least, zero, or non-zero coverage for any part of the test plan or design hierarchy.
<li> With the test-associated merge, report which tests had the most, least, zero, or non-zero sample counts for covergroups (an optional feature enabled with a modelsim.ini setting).
<li> Filter the total coverage report based on a variety of factors either anded or ored together: coverage, weight, tag name, user-defined attribute value, and unlinked status.
</ul>
<li><b>coverage unlinked</b> is a vsim -viewcov mode command for reporting test plan sections unassociated with coverage, or design/coverage objects unassociated with test plan sections.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
SV-VHDL Mixed Language support<br>
The following types are supported across the VHDL-SV mixed language boundary:<br>
<ul>
<li> VHDL instantiating SV module with ports of type: reg, logic, bit, arrays of reg, arrays of logic, arrays of bit, integer, int, shortint, longint, byte, integer unsigned, int unsigned, shortint unsigned, longint unsigned, byte unsigned</li>
<li>SV instantiating VHDL entity with ports of type: integer, natural, positive, std_logic, bit, std_logic_vector, bit_vector, signed, unsigned (Synopsys and IEEE) </li>
</ul>
Please refer to the documentation for more information.</li>
<li>
Support is added for vlog/vopt options <b>+initreg+0|1|X|Z</b> (to initialize registers) and <b>+initmem+0|1|X|Z</b> (to initialize memory).  The value 0|1|X|Z specifies that all the bits in this register or memory are to be 0 or 1 or X or Z.<br>

The user can specify <b>+initreg+&lt;seed&gt; +initmem+&lt;seed&gt;</b> to vsim.  By specifying this option, the user can have random register and/or memory initialization using the seed. Note that this random initialization is performed only on the registers and/or memory specified during the compilation using <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> options.<br>

We do not initialize notifier registers.  We can initialize sequential UDPs.  Refer to the documentation for more details.</li>
<li>
For implementing VHDL200X features, a new package named ENV has
been added to library STD. This package is also available for general
use with any VHDL language version. The package contains subprograms
"stop" and "finish", which are similar to corresponding Verilog system tasks.
It also contains a function "resolution_limit" which returns
the simulator resolution limit. For more details look in the file
modeltech/vhdl_src/std/env.vhd.
</li>
<li>
Transaction recording is supported in Verilog and SystemVerilog using the following System Tasks and Functions:<br>
<code>
$create_transaction_stream()<br>
$begin_transaction()<br>
$end_transaction()<br>
$free_transaction()<br>
$add_attribute()<br>
$add_relation()
</code></li>
<li>
Examples of how to record transactions have been added in the following directories:<br>
<code>
modeltech/examples/systemc/transactions/<br>
modeltech/examples/systemverilog/transactions/<br>
modeltech/examples/verilog/transactions/<br>
</code></li>
<li>
Support for many of the SystemVerilog data types has been added to the VPI. This has been a major overhaul of the VPI for P1800 and 1364-2005 support, an on-going effort that is not yet complete.<br>

VPI application developers should note that there are a few cases where the new VPI object model is incompatible with the Verilog-2001 model. This is not caused by ModelSim/QuestaSim but is inherent in the specifications.<br> 

In this release, the object model support default will be the 2005 behavior. This means that QuestaSim will conform to the superset of SystemVerilog and Verilog-2005, and ModelSim will conform to Verilog-2005. Users can override this default with either a command line switch <b>-plicompatdefault</b> or a modelsim.ini variable "PliCompatDefault". Set either of these to 2001 to revert the object model behavior. Note that when QuestaSim is conforming to the 2001 model, System Verilog objects will not be accessible through the VPI. Users are encouraged to migrate their applications to be compatible with the 2005 model.<br>

More detailed information about which VPI features are currently suppported is available in the documentation technotes section. </li>
<li>
The simulator now supports native debug for the Algorithmic-C data types <b>ac_int</b> and <b>ac_fixed</b>. The Algorithmic C data types are used in Catapult C Synthesis, a tool that generates optimized RTL from algorithms written as sequential ANSI-standard C/C++ specifications. These data types are synthesizable and runs faster than their SystemC counterparts sc_bigint, sc_biguint, sc_fixed and sc_ufixed. <br><br>

To use these data types in the simulator, the datatype package  must be downloaded and the path containing the AC header files must be specified with the -I option on the sccom command line.  To enable native debug support for these datatypes, the option <b>-DSC_INCLUDE_MTI_AC</b> must be specified on the sccom command line. Native debug is only supported for Version 1.2 and above.  If -DSC_INCLUDE_MTI_AC is not specified the GUI will display the C++ layout of the datatype classes.</li>
<li>
Automatic code coverage exclusions are supported. This feature is ON by default, and can be controlled either by the vsim option <b>-autoexclusions</b>, or by the modelsim.ini variable, "AutoExclusions".
<br>
Command line:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       -autoexclusions=&#60mode&#62<br>
</code>
modelsim.ini setting:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       AutoExclusions=&#60mode&#62<br>
</code>
where mode is fsm or none (default is fsm).<br>

When an fsm state is excluded, all transitions, to and from this state, are also automatically excluded.
</li>
<li>
A new tool specific system task, $messagelog(), has been added.  This task will allow the user to control certain message attributes from their native Verilog code.  This level of control was not possible in previous versions.  The message will be seen in the transcript and/or the Message Viewer, based on the msgmode setting.  Please refer to the User's Manual for more details.</li>
<li>
Display system task messages can now be seen in the Message Viewer.  By default,
these messages are only sent to the transcript.  A new command line option and modelsim.ini setting were added to control whether the messages are sent to
the transcript, Message Viewer (.wlf file), or both.<br>
Command line:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   -displaymsgmode &#60mode&#62<br>
</code>
modelsim.ini setting:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   displaymsgmode &#60mode&#62<br>
</code>
where mode is tran, wlf, or both (default is tran).<br>
The display system tasks that are affected by this are:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   $display[bho]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   $strobe[bho]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   $monitor[bho]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   $write[bho]
</code>
<br>
Also included are the analogous file I/O tasks that write to STDOUT (i.e. $fwrite or $fdisplay).

</li>
<li>
A new breakpoint column has been added to the Source window.</li>
<li>
The '$' primary in open ranges is now supported. Open range like "[10:$]" and "[$:25]" can now be used in the simulator. Examples of use are:

<pre>
     // Example 1
     covergroup cvg;
        coverpoint int_val {
           bins b = {-5, [1:$]};
        }
     endgroup

      // Example 2
      initial begin
          if ( int_val inside { [3:$], -10 } )
             $display("True");
      end
</pre></li>
<li>
User definable radicies:  A user definable radix is used to map bit patterns to a set of enumeration labels.  After defining a new radix, the radix will be available for use in the Wave and List windows or with the <b>examine</b> command.
<br>
There are four new sub commands to the <b>radix</b> command used to manage user defined radicies:
<br>
<ul>
<li>radix define <i>name</i> { <i>definition body</i> }</li>
<li>radix names</li>
<li>radix list ?<i>name</i>?</li>
<li>radix delete <i>name</i></li>
</ul>

The <b>define</b> command is used to create or modify a radix.  The definition body consists of a list of number pattern, label pairs.  See the Reference Manual for more details.<br>

The <b>names</b> command will return a list of currently defined radix names.
<br>
The <b>list</b> command will return the complete definition of a radix, if a name is given.  If no name is given, it will list all the defined radicies.
<br>
The <b>delete</b> command will remove the radix definition.
<br>
The <b>examine</b> command also has a new <b>-radix</b> option for specifying a user defined radix.  The <b>-radix</b> switch can also be used in place of the current radix options, for example <b>-radix hexidecimal</b> is the same as <b>-hex</b>.
</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>-wlfnolock</b> switch has been added to disable WLF file locking.  This will prevent vsim from checking whether a WLF file is locked prior to opening it, as well as prevent vsim from attempting to lock a WLF once it has been opened.</li>
<li>
Examples of how to record relations for transactions have been added in the following directories:<br>
<code>
modeltech/examples/systemverilog/transactions/relations/<br>
modeltech/examples/verilog/transactions/relations/
</code></li>
<li>
All exisiting SignalSpy Verilog system tasks and SignalSpy VHDL procedures now support SystemC signals as their source and/or destination objects.<br>

The following new functions have been added to allow users to make
SignalSpy calls from constructors of SC_MODULE, processes of SC_MODULE and 'simulation &amp; elaboration callbacks':<br>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>init_signal_spy()</li>
<li>disable_signal_spy()</li>
<li>enable_signal_spy()</li>
<li>signal_force()</li>
<li>signal_release()</li>
<li>init_signal_driver()</li>
</ul>

Known Limitations:&nbsp; Destination SystemC signals are not supported with init_signal_driver.</li>
<li>
There is a command <b>coverage weight</b> that sets global weights per coverage type.  These are principally useful during test traceability analysis when an entire design unit or module instance is associated with a test plan item; in that case, the coverage contributed by the design unit or module instance is the weighted average of the different types of coverage found underneath it.  Additionally, there are <b>-plan</b>, -<b>path</b>, and <b>-du</b> options to <b>coverage weight</b> that can set the weights for individual coverage items, design instances, design units, or test plan items.  This last feature could be used, for example, to set the weights within a covergroup.
</li>
<li>
A new message indicator has been added to the top of the Wave window. A colored indicator will appear at the time of the message. Users can use Tab keys and shift Tab keys to move forward and backward between messages. Double clicking on the message indicator will highlight the corresponding message in the Message Viewer tab if it's not displayed in hierarchy mode. The colors for the indicator are:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Red for error and assertion failures.
<li>Yellow for warnings.
<li>Green for notes.
<li>Otherwise light gray is used.
</ul></li>
<li>
Added support for SystemVerilog types in SystemC control/observe.
<br>

The following SystemVerilog types are supported:
<BR>
bit, logic, reg, bit vector, wire, integer, integer unsigned, int, shortint, longint, int unsigned, shortint unsigned, longint unsigned, byte, byte unsigned, packed structures, unpacked structures, packed unions, enum, nested structures (packed and unpacked), nested unions (only packed unions), real and shorteal. 
<br>
Please refer to the User's Manual for more details on SystemC control/observe.

</li>
<li>
A new compiler option <b>-nodbgsym</b> has been added to vcom and vlog to stop generating symbols debugging database in the library.</li>
<li>
Added the support for SystemC DPI debug feature including single-stepping across SC-SV call boundaries. To use this feature, Cdebug "auto step" needs to be enabled.
<br>
Known limitations:
<br>
By default, the SV breakpoints inside an export function are not supported if the export function call is initiated from a SC_METHOD process. To enable the full support, one needs to use a new vsim switch, <b>-scdpidebug</b>. For example:<br>
<code>
vsim -scdpidebug -do vsim.do top
</code>
<br>
Known issues:
<br>
Single-stepping into DPI-SC import function occasionally doesn't work if the SystemC source files are compiled with gcc-3.2.3 on linux platform. This is due to a gcc/gdb interaction issue. It is recommended that one use gcc-4.0.2 (the default gcc compiler for linux platform in 6.3 release) to compile the SystemC source code.</li>
<li>
The new "Help" toolbar will search the installed documentation for the key word(s) entered.  If the help search button is pressed with the entry box empty, it will open the InfoHub. Note: this requires the documentation be installed and a valid HTML browser to be configured and available.</li>
<li>
Added a feature to code coverage to turn off code coverage within vlog modules
declared as `celldefine/`endcelldefine, and modules included using -v and -y.
This will be disabled using old modelsim.ini files, for backwards compatibility
but enabled using new 6.3 modelsim.ini files. To disable it, set the
CoverCells variable in the modelsim.ini file to 1. To override this feature for
individual Verilog source files, there is a vlog -covercells option. There is
also a vopt -covercells option. And if CoverCells in the modelsim.ini file is
set to 1, and you want to turn it off for individual files, there is a 
vlog -nocovercells option. There is also a vopt -nocovercells option.</li>
<li>
Added support for Verilog configurations in SystemC-HDL mixed language.</li>
<li>
The option <b>-fsmnoresettrans</b> was added to vcom, vlog and vopt. This option is off by default. Use of this option disables recognition of implicit asynchronous reset transitions.</li>
<li>
Proposed IEEE fixed and floating point packages are
available in a library named floatfixlib. These packages
are compatible with language version VHDL-2002 and with earlier language versions. For more information see tech note VHDL_fixedfloat.

</li>
<li>
Member variables of SystemC modules which are defined as arrays of the following types are detected as memories and supported in memtool:<br>

<ul>
<li>sc_bigint</li>
<li>sc_biguint </li>
<li>sc_int </li>
<li>sc_uint </li>
<li>sc_signed </li>
<li>sc_unsigned </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
SystemC hierarchical channels are now displayed as "ScHierChannel" instead of "ScModule" in the Workspace window and its supported commands such as <b>describe</b> and <b>show</b>.</li>
<li>
The vcd commands are now supported for SystemC signals sc_signal&lt;T&gt;, sc_signal_resolved, sc_signal_rv&lt;N&gt; and signal ports sc_in&lt;T&gt;, sc_out&lt;T&gt; and sc_inout&lt;T&gt;, sc_in_resolved, sc_out_resolved, sc_inout_resolved, sc_in_rv&lt;N&gt;, sc_out_rv&lt;N&gt;, sc_inout_rv&lt;N&gt;. 
<br>
&lt;T&gt; can be any of the following types: <br>

<ul>
<li>unsigned char </li>
<li>unsigned short </li>
<li>unsigned int </li>
<li>unsigned long </li>
<li>unsigned long long </li>
<li>char  </li>
<li>short </li>
<li>int </li>
<li>float</li>
<li>double</li>
<li>enum</li>
<li>enum</li>
<li>sc_int</li>
<li>sc_int</li>
<li>sc_uint</li>
<li>sc_bigint</li>
<li>sc_biguint</li>
<li>sc_signed</li>
<li>sc_unsigned</li>
<li>sc_logic</li>
<li>sc_bit</li>
<li>sc_bv</li>
<li>sc_lv</li>
</ul>
Unsupported types are the SystemC fixed point types, class, structures and unions.
</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog transaction recording interface system task $end_transaction() now takes an optional third parameter, free, of type integer.  If this parameter is non-zero, the memory allotted for this transaction will be freed.  This is for convenience, and is equivalent to a separate call to $free_transaction() for this transaction.  This new parameter can be used when no more attributes will be recorded and no relations will be made for this transaction.  The default value is zero and does not free memory.</li>
<li>
We now support "Unique" and "Priority" as described in Section 10.4 of the IEEE P1800 LRM.</li>
<li>
A new key word LibrarySearchPath has been added to the modelsim.ini file, in the [vlog] section.  It is a space separated list of entries that describe were to find a resource library that contains a precompiled package.  This is identical behavior with the <b>-L</b> switch to vlog.<br>

The syntax is:<br>
LibrarySearchPath = &lt;path/libname&gt; [&lt;path/libname&gt; ...]
</li>
<li>
In the modelsim.ini file, SparseMemThreshold is set to 1048576. So memories as deep as or deeper than 1M, are marked as sparse automatically.

<br>A new vlog and vopt option called <b>+nosparse</b> is added.  This option works identically to <b>+acc</b> in terms of addressing design units, scopes or design objects (vars, mem).

<br>
Priority of sparseness:
<br>
<UL>
<LI>+nosparse[+<selection>] - These memories are marked as "not sparse".
<br>
<LI>metacomment /* sparse */ or attribute (* mti_sparse *) - These memories are marked "sparse" or "not sparse" depending on the attribute value.
<br>
<LI>SparseMemThreshold in modelsim.ini file  - Memories as deep as or deeper than this threshold are marked as sparse.
</UL>

As usual, vlog options override the vopt options.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-sv_seed</b> option for vsim now supports selection of a random seed. This is specified by <b>-sv_seed random</b>.</li>
<li>
The learn flow is extended to support SignalSpy accesses and the <b>force</b> command. Users should note that the learn mode learns the path name with the path separators in effect at the time of the learn. The same path separators should be used when the learn file is consumed. </li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 it is now possible to connect VHDL records to SystemVerilog structures on port boundaries. This is done by generating matching VHDL types from the SystemVerilog definitions.
<ul>
<li>Structures across the SystemVerilog VHDL mixed boundry can contain elements of type: reg, logic, bit, arrays of reg, arrays of logic and arrays of bit.</li>
<li>Records across the SystemVerilog VHDL mixed boundry can contain elements of type: std_logic, bit, std_logic_vector, bit_vector, signed and unsigned (Synopsys and IEEE).</li>
</ul>
For specifics consult the User's Manual on mixed language simulation.</li>
<li>
Added the <b>-noautoldlibpath</b> option to vsim so that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set internally.</li>
</ul>
