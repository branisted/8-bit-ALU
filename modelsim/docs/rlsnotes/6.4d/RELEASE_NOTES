   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * Noise in the form of a 2 pixel high residual image will sometimes appear
       at  the top of the Wave and Structure windows. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * The wave zoomrange is no longer incorrectly reset by certain actions
       (such as adding a cursor) in the Wave window when Expanded Time is
       enabled.
     * The times for cursors in the Wave window (shown in the cursor pane) are
       now correct when Expanded Time is enabled. The value which indicates the
       time difference between two cursors now indicates the number of deltas
       or number of events (depending on which Expanded Time mode is selected)
       between the two cursors if the cursors are at the same simulation time.
     * Fixed a bug when a simulation is run for an additional amount after
       Expanded Time is enabled in the Wave window.
     * Fixed several problems with panning/scrolling/zooming when Expanded Time
       is enabled in the Wave window.
     * Fixed a crashing bug when enabling Expanded Time in a Wave window which
       contains certain types of signals (e.g. edited waveforms).
     * Message markers are now drawn at the correct time/location when Expanded
       Time is enabled in the Wave window.
     * "Expand  Packed Mem" and "Identify Memories Within Cells" were not
       functioning good through the GUI in terms of updating the memory list
       and their toggle state in menus.
     * Within a given VHDL architecture, if multiple blocks exist with the same
       name, objects declared within the blocks would get confused. This would
       result in incorrect results for the add log, add wave, add list, and
       examine commands.
     * Verilog process variables can now be logged.
     * ModelSim/Questasim crashed when trying to add a SystemVerilog static
       string array into Wave window or List window.
     * System Verilog inout typed enums didn't show any value in the wave
       window.
     * In Wave window, expanding any bus which has been assigned a color causes
       a crash of the simulator. This issue has been resolved.
     * Testplan Import in the Verification Manager failed if the directory or
       filename of the input or output files had spaces in them.
     * For   the   Wave  window,  the  Save  Image  dialog  accessed  via
       File->Export->Image... menu pick did not automatically add the .bmp
       extension when Files of type was set to "Bitmap (*.bmp)".
     * Wave window postscript printing does not work with some printers. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * Context-menu item "Save Files..." restored to "Files" pane... emits a
       sorted duplicate-free list of all the files used in the design (based on
       "write report").
     * Verilog reg bits and VHDL array elements where sometimes displayed
       incorrectly when the display was zoomed out.
     * The find insource command sometimes produces an internal Tcl error. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * Waveforms were sometimes drawn incorrectly (or not drawn at all) when
       using Expanded Time Deltas Mode or Expanded Time Events Mode if the
       simulation time at the right edge of the Wave window was a time that had
       no events. This has been fixed.
     * When  issuing  a  waveform  compare, where the 'gold' WLF file has
       assertions that does not exist in the 'test' WLF file, an incorrect
       failure with the following error could occur but now compares correctly.
       Fatal  WLF  Error (2): ../../../src/tkgui/compare.c(2639) Internal
       assertion: testRegion!=NULL
     * The noforce command failed when applied to a net whose name consisted of
       a  Verilog-format extended identifier, where the characters of the
       identifier terminated with a space-character. The command produced an
       error with the message, "No objects found".
     * When using a location map, the soft path was not correctly expanded if
       choosing the design unit and doing a recompile from the popup menu
       (Library Window Popup Menu > Recompile).
     * Fixed a crash related to waveform comparisons involving SC FIFO under
       certain circumstances.
     * Selecting a memory within the Memory window, and issuing the "Export
       data patterns" command would work properly the first time. A second
       attempt to issue this command on the same memory would result in an
       error. The issue has been corrected.
     * The preference "testtrackercolumnMap" saved in the .modelsim file to
       preserve the column order for the Verification Management Tracker window
       between sessions. Some operations resulted in the invalid value of "-1"
       being included in the list of column numbers saved for the value of that
       preference. This invalid value in turn caused tcl errors when using the
       Tracker window in older releases (prior to 6.4). This invalid value,
       "-1", will no longer be saved ! in the .modelsim file and will no longer
       cause tcl errors (in 6.3k and later) if it exists in a .modelsim file.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * The compiler produced an internal error in some cases when a module port
       was declared as a type defined in a package.
     * If a design with a nested configuration is optimized by vopt, then vsim
       is invoked on the optimized design, but with the -novopt switch, the
       simulator will incorrectly attempt to load the unoptimized version of
       the nested configuration, and will report the error message:
       "** Error: Could not find machine code for ..."
     * An out-of-bounds assignment to an array of reals resulted in a simulator
       crash in some cases.
     * Simple macros can be both defined and used within the context of another
       macro.
     * The simulator could crash with SystemVerilog designs where a wire in a
       package has the same dimensions as a register in a module. For example:
package g_pkg;
   wire [ 1 : 0 ] ww ;
endpackage

module g;
   import g_pkg::ww;
   reg  [ 1 : 0 ]  rrr;
endmodule
     * The simulator would crash when a clocking block used a concatenation
       containing a hierarchical bit select or slice.
     * A design optimized with +acc=n and +floatparameters resulted in a GUI
       crash  when  accessing  a vector net having a range dependent on a
       parameter.
     * In some cases, designs with false generate conditions would fail to
       elaborate if vopt was not used.
     * Functions  in  nested module were not being recognized as constant
       function. This has now been fixed.
     * A  constant  function inside a class when calling another constant
       function from an outer scope,was not recognized as a constant function.
       This has now been fixed.
     * Declaration a parameter or localparam with a complex value expression
       inside of a task or function would sometimes give an internal error
       like:
         ** Error: test.sv(12): Internal error:
       ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(129) vl_save_stack_on_wait
     * For unique case statement, invoking vopt with the option +acc=f would
       sometimes result in error such as:
       Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(10724) !is_cancelledOf(e)
       This is now fixed.
     * A Verilog file was parsed as a SystemVerilog file when vlog was run with
       -mfcu and one of the files had something in $unit scope.
     * vlog  and  vopt  would  sometimes  report an internal error when a
       hierarchical reference was used to call first(), last(), next() and
       prev() on an associative array. The error message was:
       ** Error: bug.sv(14): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(7833)
       t
     * Some optimized sequential cells did not function correctly after a
       timingcheck violation. There outputs appeared to be stuck at X.
     * Slicing  an  array  of  interfaces  using parameters, For example,
       intf_inst[0 : p2] might have resulted in an "Unexpected signal: 11" in
       vlog or vopt. This has now been fixed.
     * vlog would crash when reading the Verilog source text "`pragma reset
       protect".
     * The  wrong delay path is selected when an unoptimized Verilog cell
       specifies delay path as (dataa *> dataout).
     * Assigning an unsized 'x' or 'z' to a register wider than 32-bits only
       set the low 32-bits.
     * When a module contains multiple UDP instances and the different UDP's
       are compiled in different libraries then for vopt mode, vsim sometimes
       produces the following error message:
       **     Error:     (vsim-3033)     top.v(7):    Instantiation    of
       '/test/bug/lib3.ut_udp2(verilog)' failed. The design unit was not found.
       This has been fixed.
     * vlog would fail to read a design while issuing the error:
       ... unexpected "end of source code".
     * Casting a parameter of string type to an integer type would sometimes
       produce a crash or give wrong results. This is now fixed.
     * A continuous assignment having a variable driver delay behaved as if
       there was no delay in some cases if the assignment was from one vector
       net to another of equal width.
     * Under certain circumstances (e.g. a method in a parameterized class, a
       forward typedef), vlog would print an invalid error about a field of a
       struct not being found.
     * Backslash characters would not be properly formatted within string
       literals in the output of vlog's -E option.
     * A non-wire connection to a module port net declared with a "net delay"
       simulated with zero delay in an optimized design if the module instance
       was inlined.
     * An always block triggered by a hierarchical reference (or a structure
       field  select)  failed  to  trigger  in some cases in an optimized
       SystemVerilog design.
     * An illegal assign to a void function name when the function is declared
       as extern caused a segmentation fault. This is now fixed.
     * In  order  to support SDF annotation of protected Verilog regions,
       $sdf_annotate calls that meet certain conditions are "hoisted" and
       treated as if they were specified on vsim command line. The conditions
       are that $sdf_annotate is either the first statement in a block or every
       statement  preceding  it  is a built-in systask. (We used to allow
       user-defined systasks too. Now restricted to built-in systasks only).
     * Continuous assignment to a wire from an untyped parameter might have
       resulted in a wrong value. This has now been fixed.
     * Assigning an interface-array formal port to a virtual interface could
       cause a runtime crash.
     * Verilog or SystemVerilog string parameter overrides from the command
       line(-G/-g) can now be specified without double-quoting the string. For
       example -Gstring_param=Hello.
     * Using  the +initreg=u switch to initialize UDP registers may cause
       incorrect simulation results.
     * NaN  results  from  a divide-by-zero operation in a variable delay
       expression is not detected and properly reported.
     * vlog printed an internal error when a continuous assignment used a
       concatenation of individual bits of an enum variable.
     * The  vsim  command line option +notimingchecks may cause incorrect
       simulation result in an optimized sequential cell that models negative
       timing checks.
     * Simultaneous events did not always violate $hold and $recovery timing
       checks.
     * Timing checks disabled with limits set to zero were not being used to
       solve delay net delays required by negative timing check limits.
     * Fixed a $system() issues that only existed on Windows.
     * An event control having either a posedge or negedge on a part-select of
       a vector register incorrectly triggered when the edge occurred on bits
       other than the LSB of the part-select.
     * If a replication operation with a zero replication multiplier appears
       inside a concatenation, it will be considered to be of size zero and
       ignored.
     * An always block that assigned to a variable with a blocking assignment
       incorrectly re-queued the same always block for execution in some cases
       if the variable also appeared in the sensitivity list of the event
       control. While an always block is running, none of its event controls
       should be considered active.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * This release fixes some problems with the bits derived by VPI iteration
       on some classes of nets and ports.
     * Some learn mode defects have been fixed. One defect caused the simulator
       to crash when the VPI application used the vpi_put_value() function
       under certain conditions. Another defect caused the simulator to crash
       for some SignalSpy usages.
     * PLI/FLI shared objects that register exit callbacks using g_atexit()
       would sometime crash the simulator during quit. This is fixed now.
     * The  vpiScope  and  vpiModule transitions from VPI objects of type
       vpiGenScope are now available.
     * Some issues getting VPI objects that are subcomponents of complex mixed
       unpacked/packed structs using vpi_handle_by_name() have been fixed.
     * VPI assertion callback was not working correctly when assertion property
       was disabled by disable_iff construct. This has now been fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * Complex  expressions  in  the  binding  indications of a component
       configuration could be incorrectly optimized.
     * The simulator could crash when elaborating a design with a subtype local
       to a function and in which the subtype refers to array attributes of the
       return value of that function.
     * In some cases when VHDL blocks had generic maps with generic dependent
       port  ranges and were used inside generates, a port mismatch error
       occurs. This is now fixed
     * Some error conditions were not detected when a force command was applied
       to a subelement of a composite port of mode in or inout. Error number
       3456 is now correctly issued in these cases.
     * The simulator crashed when attempting to load a black box design with an
       optimized VHDL top-level design unit.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * mti_GetSignalSubelements would incorrectly report an error if the signal
       argument was a signal that did not contain any scalar signals. A signal
       will not contain any scalar signals if it is an array of length 0 (NULL
       array) or is record with no fields or all the fields are NULL arrays.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * In VITAL memory models, some HOLD violations were incorrectly reported
       as SETUP violations, and some HOLD violations reported an incorrect
       state (High vs. Low). This issue has been resolved.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * Added support for the SystemVerilog disable statement that involves
       DPI-SC calls.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * vsim crashed when using boolean repeats with repeat count greater than
       10000.
     * vlog gave parsing error for valid embedded PSL code present in a module
       compiled with -v switch but not being used in the design.
     * Forward referencing in now supported in PSL.
     * vlog gave error when concatenation operator '{var}' was used in PSL
       built-in functions.
     * Use of unclocked PSL built-in in abort expression caused vlog to give
       internal error.
     * The HTML report was not showing the Assertions Summary consistently with
       the command vcover stats (the HTML report was only showing assertion
       successes). Now it is consistent with vcover stats, and shows Assertion
       Passes and Assertion Failures.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * Using  SignalSpy  to mirror the value of single-bit vectors at the
       SystemVerilog-VHDL boundary, e.g. VHDL std_logic_vector(4 to 4) to
       Verilog reg [0:0], would produce an incorrect type mismatch error. This
       has been fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * Applying statement exclusions to entire source files used to ignore the
       -item argument. This is fixed now.
     * Fixed a bug regarding exclusion report for "case" branches.
     * A problem with clearing "case" branch bins exclusion in coverage view
       mode has been fixed.
     * Fixed the possibility of a vsim crash when code coverage is on and a
       SystemVerilog generate block contains an instance which is inlined. For
       the  moment  we are inhibiting inlining of the instance within the
       generate block. A full repair will not be possible in the 6.4x release
       sequence, but will be included in a later release.
     * The GUI incorrectly highlighted portions of text when multiple Verilog
       statements were found on a single line of source.
     * HTML coverage reports can now be generated for the simulation dataset.
     * The "View Coverage Details" item of popup menu in the Verification
       Management Tracker window is now disabled (grayed out) when the row
       selected has a type which has no coverage details.
     * Excluded toggles incorrectly show up in HTML coverage reports. This is
       fixed.
     * The  HTML summary report now shows the count of passing tests with
       warnings separately.
     * Wrong toggle coverage statistics shown in Workspace window in simulation
       mode when some bits of a vector are excluded.
     * The Missed Coverage window did not show the last "elsif" missed branch
       when "else" was absent in the branch.
     * A Missed expression was showing as a missed condition in viewcov mode
       when only FEC of the expression was missed.
     * Merge produced incorrect toggle 0->Z transition counts.
     * VHDL process statements were not getting included in statement coverage.
       This was inconsistent with Verilog where we included always statements
       in statement coverage. Now VHDL process statements will appear in code
       coverage.
     * Sometimes  when  compiling a design unit with -cover bcesft, which
       instantiates a design unit compiled with -cover bcesfx, the following
       erroneous error would occur:
       ** Error: (vcom-1913) Ambiguous options bcesfx, toggle and extended
       toggle both specified.
       This has been fixed.
     * There are two different coverage flows:
        The Manual Flow that includes toggle add/disable/enable.
        The Compile/Simulator Flow that includes vsim coverage with coverage
            exclude.
       Fixed a problem when using the toggle add command from the first flow
       and then excluding nodes using the coverage exclude command from the
       second flow.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.4d
     * The string "(null)" appears in the transcript when some SignalSpy errors
       are suppressed. This issue has been resolved.
     * vcover could crash when merging UCDB files for certain VHDL designs.
       This has been corrected.
     * Attempting to add wave, list or log a VlTypedef would cause a crash.
     * The Verilog API method for transaction recording, $begin_transaction(),
       failed to handle its "begin_time" parameter correctly. The parameter was
       treated as if it were a 32-bit integer time. This has been corrected.
     * For the -vcdstim feature, ascending order buses (i.e. 0 to 31) could
       sometimes be reversed in the resulting vcdstim simulation.
     * Using checkpoint/restore with designs that use the built-in OVM library
       crash on restore or restart. This issue has been resolved.
     * In some cases under OVM, transaction streams were mis-named with the
       string    passed    as    the    "stream    kind"   parameter   to
       $create_transaction_stream(). This has been corrected.
     * The vmake utility generates combined make rules for Verilog design units
       when the source files are compiled with the same command line arguments.
       In some cases, the vlog command for the combined rule did not list all
       the source files.
     * Batch mode execution of dofiles containing add wave commands could fail
       to be replaced with the equivalent log commands. This has been fixed.
     * When a library containing an optimized "black box" (bbox) design is
       moved to a new location, incorrect "file not found" errors were reported
       when a fatal error occurred.
     * -gen_xml will function normally when the library and/or module files are
       read-only.
     * When  using -mixedansiports, vlog continues to generate a warning.
       Changed  the  handling  (for  -mixed cases ONLY) so the warning is
       suppressible by the customer.
     * Fixed problems with UCDB TESTSTATUS in simulation mode.
     * Added exclusion information to the XML report.
     * Fixed problems with Generated HTML report and altered it to be more like
       GUI/tracker.
     * Fixed UCDB coverage save hang.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.4d
     * dts0100254528 - Wave window displays misleading information.
     * dts0100258656  - Wave window does not shows all events on a bus on
       Solaris.
     * dts0100514324 - Invalid warning: WLF and DBG files do not appear to be
       from the same design.
     * dts0100514601 - Problem logging signals to sub-groups with same name in
       Wave window.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.4d
     * On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set
       via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop
       at the breakpoint.
     * On  Windows  platform,  if  breakpoint  is set on a SystemC object
       destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This
       crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which
       will prevent unloading of the shared library.
     * The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in
       behavior compared to the vsim mode version. In the viewcov mode version,
       clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the
       coverage data for that design unit, itself. Also, if you clear coverage
       data  in  a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not
       affected by that operation. In vsim mode, the data is more tightly
       linked such that one operation affects the other. In viewcov mode, if
       you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design
       units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
       on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an add
       wave command, when the working directory was created under an older
       32-bit Linux OS.
       This  is  a  Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
       simulator.
       A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator with
       command line option -wlfnolock.
     * The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable. The unwinder is
       the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program
       execution is at. The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance
       data. This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance
       data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.
     * Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and
       memory  profiling at the same time. Memory profiling requires much
       overhead  process,  and it can skew the results of the performance
       profiling data.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on
       consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.
     * On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs
       during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal,
       and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting
       with proper error status.
     * vlog  will  now  print  an  "unsupported" error message for nested
       design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3. This error
       may be suppressed using the -suppress 2230 command-line options.
     * For  viewing  events  in Expanded Time in the List window, use the
       "configure list" command with the "-delta events" option. "events" is
       added to the "all", "collapse", and "none" options for the "-delta"
       argument. These options control the details shown in the List window and
       in writing list files. This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded
       Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis"
       chapter of the User's Manual. The "write list -events" command serves a
       different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control
       Expanded Time viewing in List window.
     * The examine, searchlog, and seetime commands have NOT been enhanced for
       use with Expanded Time. This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded
       Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of the "Waveform
       Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
     * If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of
       warning:
       # Loading mypackage(body)
       #  Internal  Warning  in process_sub: failed to find local inlined
       subprogram called in pkg
       # (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2
       # Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram
       Then add the -noFunctionInline option to vcom for that package, or
       reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they
       are used.
     * Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules,
       interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
       module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
       code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
       instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.
     * Using the profiler on Solaris 8 can result in the error, "Setitimer:
       Permission denied." To prevent this error, set the environment variable
       MTI_THREAD_DISABLE to 1.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.4d
     * The name of the -totals argument to the vcover ranktest and coverage
       ranktest commands has been changed to -iterative. Functionally, the
       arguments are identical.
     * In some cases the -vmake flag will be required to correctly capture
       Verilog source file dependencies.
     * The priority of +initreg/+initmem options is adjusted from the previous
       versions. Now, the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vopt with
       design unit or instance name have the highest priority. After that,
       these  options applied to vlog have the next priority and the vopt
       +initreg/+initmem options have the last priority. In earlier versions,
       the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vlog command had higher
       priority than design unit or instance specific +initreg/+initmem vopt
       options.
     * To improve usability, the Run toolbar has been changed: a Break button
       has been added.
     * The text-based windows (Transcript, Notepad and Source) now have an
       "inline" search bar (instead of a dialog box) which supports incremental
       searching.  The  previous  behavior  can  be  restored  using  the
       "Main/InlineTextSearch" option.
     * Several fatal elaboration errors will now print the line # where the
       error occurred.
     * The  new  enhanced support of analog format within the Wave window
       includes a change to the output created by "write format wave". In
       pre-6.4 the output for the "add wave" commands would include "-offset"
       and "-scale". Starting in 6.4 the output will instead use "-min" and
       "-max".
     * When vpi_iterate and vpi_scan are used on an array of instances, the
       individual elements will now be returned left-to-right, where they
       formerly were returned low-to-high. For example if they are applied to
       "mymodule u1[2:0]();", the elements returned will be u1[2], u1[1],
       u1[0].
     * Each tag in a taglist (used as data extraction parameters) may now
       include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by
       tag  name  but also by the contents of attributes attached to said
       elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can
       only  examine  the  attribute values attached to the element being
       compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.
       For example, the following extraction parameter:
"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"
       will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet>
       but will not match the following element:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet>
     * The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility
       has  been  clarified  to  allow  various  parameters  to work more
       independently.  The  affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags,
       excludetags, and startstoring.
     * VCD extensions for SystemVerilog supported as per Section 24: VCD Data
       in IEEE-P1800. LRM is not extending VCD for interfaces and programs.
       They will be dumped as "module" scope.
     * The Source window has been changed to remove the separate column used to
       display breakpoints. Breakpoints will be shown within the "line number"
       column (as they were in the pre-6.3 releases). The LMB event handling
       has been improved to avoid inadvertent setting of breakpoints. Also,
       there is now a subtle visual separator bar between the text area and the
       line number column to help guide the user during text selection.
     * The coverage numbers shown in the source window can appear to be in
       conflict with what's shown in the "Missed Coverage" window. This occurs
       when the Missed Coverage window is in "By Instance" mode and the source
       window is in "By File" mode. The latter is the default for the source
       window but it gives no indication what its current mode is. To make it
       clear for the user, the title bar of the source window will be enhanced
       to  include the current coverage data mode(either "by file" or "by
       instance").
     * The Contains toolbar now supports multiple wildcard modes. The default
       mode is now "glob" style which is the more common form of wildcards as
       found in UNIX shells. The wildcards are *, ?, [chars], and \x where x is
       any character, removing that character's special meaning.
       Previously, this filtering tool used full regular expressions. This
       option is selectable from the menu button in the Contains entry box, by
       selecting the value "regular-expression".
       The third option, "exact", does not use wildcards so no characters have
       any special meaning.
       In all modes, the search patterns are considered case insensitive. If a
       case sensitive pattern is needed, use the regular-expression mode and
       perpend the search string with "(?c)".
       The preference variable PrefMain(ContainsMode) defines the filter mode
       for all windows with one of the values of "glob", "regexp", or "exact".
       More  information  on  regular expressions can be found in the Tcl
       reference manual under "re_syntax". Information on glob style matching
       can  be found in the Tcl reference manual under the "string match"
       command.
     * Macro arguments to Verilog and SystemVerilog macros are now expanded
       prior to substitution into the macro body.
     * SDF  annotation  of  RECREM  or  SETUPHOLD  matching only a single
       setup/hold/recovery/removal  timing check will result in a warning
       message.
     * The transaction recording engine no longer issues a warning if a design
       attempts to record a transaction of zero length.
     * The log and nolog commands are now supported for transaction streams of
       all kinds. TR streams created through the SCV or Verilog APIs have
       logging enabled by default. The rule is that a transaction will be
       logged in WLF if logging is enabled at the simulation time when the
       design calls ::begin_transaction() or $begin_transaction. The effective
       start  time of the transaction (the time passed by the design as a
       parameter to beginning the transaction) does not matter. Thus, a stream
       could  have  logging disabled between T1 and T2 and still record a
       transaction in that period using retroactive logging after time T2. A
       transaction is always entirely logged or entirely ignored.
     * PSL LTL and OBE operators are now disabled by default. Use -pslext
       vcom/vlog/vopt switch to enable these operators.
     * The Win32/Win32PE platform executables (excluding vish.exe) are now
       linked  with  the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch. This switch allows an
       executable to allocate an extra gigabyte of process space (up to 3GB).
       The  additional  gigabyte of process space is available on Windows
       configurations that include the /3GB (/userva on Vista) boot switch.
       Vish.exe is not linked with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE and we do not recommended
       that this switch be used with vish.exe. Testing vish.exe with this
       switch exhibited a tendency to exceed the one GB system limitation which
       results in a crash. When the simulator's GUI displays several windows
       with  large  amounts of graphical data and a full redraw occurs, a
       temporary surge in the allocation of system memory can cause the limit
       to be exceeded.
     * The  behavior  of virtual expressions has changed in a subtle way.
       Normally when a virtual expression contains a relative context pathname,
       for example u1/x2/b, the current context would be used in order to
       resolve the name. However, relative paths that started with a toplevel
       name  would also be recognized, ignoring the current context. This
       unintended behavior has been corrected so that the current context is
       always used to resolve a relative name. This may cause some previously
       accepted virtual expressions to fail to be accepted.
     * modules found through source library search are no longer treated by
       default as if they contained a `celldefine compiler directive. To obtain
       the old behavior, add +libcell to the vlog command line. Source library
       search is enabled with -v and -y compilation options. Whether a module
       is considered a cell or not affects logging defaults with log -r *,
       coverage  defaults  within  the  module,  and  PLI access routines
       acc_next_cell and acc_next_cell_load. This change simplifies migration
       from other simulator products.
     * Support for Verilog hierarchical references through VHDL design units
       has  been  greatly  improved.  It is now possible for hierarchical
       references from a higher level Verilog to refer to objects in a Verilog
       module instantiated beneath a VHDL design unit. In previous releases,
       upward references from a lower level Verilog module would only work if
       the  target's  scope  was  a  direct parent, or a sibling that was
       instantiated lexically earlier in source. This restrictions are now
       removed. Hierarchical references that pass through a VHDL design will
       not work in the follow cases:
          + Is the target of a defparam.
          + Used as an actual to a unconstrained VHDL port.
          + Target of the reference is a VHDL object.
     * A  new toolbar has been added to the Wave window for access to the
       existing Bookmark functionality.
     * Enabled use of the "contains" filter for the Files tab of the Workspace
       window.
     * Support for some additional VPI features has been added in this release.
       The vpiDriver transition has been extended, and partial support for
       vpiContAssign objects has been added.
     * When  encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters
       defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the
       encrypted Verilog file.
     * Wave searches initiated from the keyboard or toolbar buttons can now be
       stopped by clicking the Wave window's "Stop Wave Drawing" toolbar button
       or the Simulation toolbar's "Break" button.
     * The SystemVerilog array manipulation methods now reflect the latest
       changes in the P1800 Draft5 version of the LRM, in that iteration occurs
       only in the top dimension of the array. That is, the correct way to sum
       the  elements of a 2-dimensional memory, as indicated in the LRM's
       example, is:
       logic [7:0] m [2][2] = '{ '{5, 10}, '{15, 20} };
       int y;
       y = m.sum with (item.sum with (item)); // y becomes 50 => 5+10+15+20
       Previously, ModelSim iterated through all the unpacked dimensions,
       "[2][2]" in this case.
     * When using the C-debugger to debug quit callback functions, the user
       needed to turn on 'stop on quit' mode. Users start debugging by issuing
       the quit -f command. When simulation the ends, the user needed to quit
       the C-debugger using cdbg quit and then the GUI using quit -f. Now,
       users  do  not need to issue extra commands at the end of the run.
       Simulator automatically quits the C-debugger and GUI, after debugging is
       done and the simulation has stopped running.
     * If a VHDL signal is read during elaboration the value read may differ
       from  value read in previous releases. The VHDL LRM considers this
       illegal(Section 12.3) but tool behavior has always been to just warn and
       allow a value to be read. What the value read has always been undefined.
       Additionally previous releases allowed functions and procedure with
       signal parameter to be called during elaboration. This is now illegal
       and reported at compile time.
     * The menus which control the functional coverage tab display options
       (assertion, cover directives and functional coverage) have changed
       slightly. Most significant of the changes is that each pane now has a
       separate control for "Show All Contexts" and "Recursive Mode" that is
       not shared with the other panes. They are available with the right mouse
       click popup window as well as under the tool's main menu, under the
       "Display Options" menu pick.
     * The bp command now outputs a list of existing C breakpoints with their
       enabled/disabled states in the bp command syntax, so that this output
       can be saved and executed later to recreate the breakpoints.
     * The effect of assertions on some coverage features has changed. Because
       assertion pass counts were not reliable without -assertdebug used in
       simulation, pass counts have been removed from the coverage database and
       reports by default. (With -assertdebug, they remain, along with other
       counts.) Also, the contribution of assertions to total coverage, in the
       Verification Management Tracker and Browser, has changed. Previously, an
       assertion contributed to "100% coverage" if it non-vacuously passed at
       least  once.  Now, with -assertdebug, "100% coverage" is met if an
       assertion  both  non-vacuously  passed  and  never failed. Without
       -assertdebug, "100% coverage" is met if the assertion never failed.
       There is a new VM Browser column called "%SuccessAsserts" to indicate
       this  statistic.  If  assertions are included in a test plan, this
       statistic is automatically used in the VM Tracker and coverage analyze
       command.
     * Following modifications have been done to coverage switches:

            Earlier name             New name
       -coverNoSub            -nocoversub

     * Errors involving unpacked array assignment, where the packed elements do
       not match exactly (signed/unsigned, different widths, 2-state/4-state),
       may now be suppressed using '-suppress 7034'.
     * The  HTML report now shows the total number of covergroup bins per
       coverpoint  or  cross  and,  of those, how many were covered. This
       information appears on the covergroup details pages for each scope.
     * When the simulation encounters an error during a run, a message will be
       displayed  showing the file and line location of the error and the
       sequence of calls showing how it got there. This is an extension of the
       Stopped At message displayed previously. In GUI mode, this message may
       be used to view the file by double-clicking on the file name in the
       message.   This   message   may   be  suppressed  by  setting  the
       PrefMain(noRunMsg) preference to 1.
     * The assertion gui panel now will save the state of the display option
       settings when the simulation exits.
     * The vsim -title switch can now be used with the -load_elab switch.
       Previously this option was disallowed.

   New Features Added to 6.4d
     * When using the File > Open method to open a WLF log file, the contained
       signals were automatically added into a Wave window. A new Wave window
       preference has been added to control whether this "auto add" is done.
       The setting is accessed in the Preferences dialog, on the "By Name"
       page,   in  the  "Wave"  section.  The  name  of  the  setting  is
       "OpenLogAutoAddWave".
     * Added limited support for export function debugging of outoftheblue
       DPI-C call. One can set breakpoints in or step through export function
       during the execution of outoftheblue DPI-C call. However, this support
       is only limited in the outoftheblue DPI-C calls that are initiated from
       inside a SystemC thread or a SystemC method:
          + To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated
            from inside a SystemC thread, vsim switch -dpioutoftheblue 2 is
            needed.
          + To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated
            from inside a SystemC method, Both vsim switch -scdpidebug and
            -dpioutoftheblue 2 are needed.
       For any other kinds of outoftheblue DPI-C calls, no debugging support is
       available.
     * Transaction streams may be created with a full or relative path name. If
       the path leads to an existing region, the stream will be created in that
       region. The GUI icon for the stream depends on the region in which the
       stream appears. (MVC streams do not follow this convention, having their
       own icons.) To match a relative path, the tool may search upward from
       the calling region. This change applies to streams created in SystemC,
       Verilog or SystemVerilog. For example,
       "$create_transaction_stream(".top.dut.stream") will create a stream
       called "stream" in the region ".top.dut" if that region exists.
     * Added the -dpiforceheader switch to vlog/vopt/vsim commands to force
       generate DPI header even when empty of function prototypes.
     * The XML report [commands: coverage report -xml and vcover report -xml]
       was not showing test attributes in the case where the -testattr argument
       was passed.
       Now the report is showing them surrounded by the XML tags <test></test>
       for each test.
