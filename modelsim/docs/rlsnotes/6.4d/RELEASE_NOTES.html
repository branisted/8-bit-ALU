<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Noise in the form of a 2 pixel high residual image will sometimes appear at the top of the Wave and Structure windows.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
The wave zoomrange is no longer incorrectly reset by certain actions (such as adding a cursor) in the Wave window when Expanded Time is enabled.</li>
<li>
The times for cursors in the Wave window (shown in the cursor pane) are now correct when Expanded Time is enabled.  The value which indicates the time difference between two cursors now indicates the number of deltas or number of events (depending on which Expanded Time mode is selected) between the two cursors if the cursors are at the same simulation time.</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug when a simulation is run for an additional amount after Expanded Time is enabled in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Fixed several problems with panning/scrolling/zooming when Expanded Time is enabled in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Fixed a crashing bug when enabling Expanded Time in a Wave window which contains certain types of signals (e.g. edited waveforms).
</li>
<li>
Message markers are now drawn at the correct time/location when Expanded Time is enabled in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
"Expand Packed Mem" and "Identify Memories Within Cells" were not functioning good through the GUI in terms of updating the memory list and their toggle state in menus.
</li>
<li>
Within a given VHDL architecture, if multiple blocks exist with the same name,
objects declared within the blocks would get confused. This would result in incorrect results for the <b>add log</b>, <b>add wave</b>, <b>add list</b>, and <b>examine</b> commands.
</li>
<li>
Verilog process variables can now be logged.</li>
<li>
ModelSim/Questasim crashed when trying to add a SystemVerilog static string array into Wave window or List window.
</li>
<li>
System Verilog inout typed enums didn't show any value in the wave window.</li>
<li>
In Wave window, expanding any bus which has been assigned a color causes a crash of the simulator.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
Testplan Import in the Verification Manager failed if the directory or filename of the input or output files had spaces in them.</li>
<li>
For the Wave window, the Save Image dialog accessed via File->Export->Image... menu pick did not automatically add the .bmp extension when Files of type was set to "Bitmap (*.bmp)".
</li>
<li>
Wave window postscript printing does not work with some printers.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
Context-menu item "Save Files..." restored to "Files" pane... emits a sorted duplicate-free list of all the files used in the design (based on "write report").
</li>
<li>
Verilog reg bits and VHDL array elements where sometimes displayed incorrectly when the display was zoomed out. </li>
<li>
The <b>find insource</b> command sometimes produces an internal Tcl error.  This issue has been resolved.  
</li>
<li>
Waveforms were sometimes drawn incorrectly (or not drawn at all) when using Expanded Time Deltas Mode or Expanded Time Events Mode if the simulation time at the right edge of the Wave window was a time that had no events.  This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
When issuing a waveform compare, where the 'gold' WLF file has assertions that does not exist in the 'test' WLF file, an incorrect failure with the following error could occur but now compares correctly.<br>
<code>
Fatal WLF Error (2): ../../../src/tkgui/compare.c(2639) Internal assertion: testRegion!=NULL
</code>
</li>
<li>
The <b>noforce</b> command failed when applied to a net whose name consisted of a Verilog-format extended identifier, where the characters of the identifier terminated with a space-character. The command produced an error with the message, "No objects found".
</li>
<li>
When using a location map, the soft path was not correctly expanded if choosing the design unit and doing a recompile from the popup menu (Library Window Popup Menu > Recompile).</li>
<li>
Fixed a crash related to waveform comparisons involving SC FIFO under certain circumstances.
</li>
<li>
Selecting a memory within the Memory window, and issuing the "Export data patterns" command would work properly the first time.  A second attempt to issue this command on the same memory would result in an error.  The issue has been corrected.</li>
<li>
The preference "testtrackercolumnMap" saved in the .modelsim file to preserve the column order for the Verification Management Tracker window between sessions. Some operations resulted in the invalid value of "-1" being included in the list of column numbers saved for the value of that preference. This invalid value in turn caused tcl errors when using the Tracker window in older releases (prior to 6.4). This invalid value, "-1", will no longer be saved ! in the .modelsim file and will no longer cause tcl errors (in 6.3k and later) if it exists in a .modelsim file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The compiler produced an internal error in some cases when a module port was declared as a type defined in a package.</li>
<li>
If a design with a nested configuration is optimized by vopt, then vsim is invoked on the optimized design, but with the <b>-novopt</b> switch, the simulator will incorrectly attempt to load the unoptimized version of the nested configuration, and will report the error message:<br>
<code>
"** Error: Could not find machine code for ..."
</code>
</li>
<li>
An out-of-bounds assignment to an array of reals resulted in a simulator crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
Simple macros can be both defined and used within the context of another macro.</li>
<li>
The simulator could crash with SystemVerilog designs where a wire in a package has the same dimensions as a register in a module.  For example:
<pre>
package g_pkg;
   wire [ 1 : 0 ] ww ;
endpackage

module g;
   import g_pkg::ww;
   reg  [ 1 : 0 ]  rrr;
endmodule
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The simulator would crash when a clocking block used a concatenation containing a hierarchical bit select or slice. </li>
<li>
A design optimized with <b>+acc=n</b> and <b>+floatparameters</b> resulted in a GUI crash when accessing a vector net having a range dependent on a parameter.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, designs with false generate conditions would fail to elaborate if vopt was not used.</li>
<li>
Functions in nested module were not being recognized as constant function. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>
A constant function inside a class when calling another constant function from an outer scope,was not recognized as a constant function. This has now been fixed.
</li>
<li>
Declaration a parameter or localparam with a complex value expression inside of a task or function would sometimes give an internal error like:<br><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;** Error: test.sv(12): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(129)
vl_save_stack_on_wait</code></li>
<li>
For unique case statement, invoking vopt with the option <b>+acc=f</b> would sometimes result in error such as:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(10724) !is_cancelledOf(e)
</code>
<br>This is now fixed.
</li>
<li>
A Verilog file was parsed as a SystemVerilog file when vlog was run with <b>-mfcu</b> and one of the files had something in $unit scope.
</li>
<li>
vlog and vopt would sometimes report an internal error when a hierarchical reference was used to call <code>first()</code>, <code>last()</code>, <code>next()</code> and <code>prev()</code> on an associative array.  The error message was:<br><code>
** Error: bug.sv(14): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(7833) t
</code>
</li>
<li>
Some optimized sequential cells did not function correctly after a timingcheck violation. There outputs appeared to be stuck at X.  
</li>
<li>
Slicing an array of interfaces using parameters, For example, intf_inst[0 : p2] might have resulted in an "Unexpected signal: 11" in vlog or vopt. This has now been fixed.
</li>
<li>
vlog would crash when reading the Verilog source text "`pragma reset protect".</li>
<li>
The wrong delay path is selected when an unoptimized Verilog cell specifies delay path as (dataa *> dataout).
</li>
<li>
Assigning an unsized 'x' or 'z' to a register wider than 32-bits only set the low 32-bits.
</li>
<li>
When a module contains multiple UDP instances and the different UDP's are compiled in different libraries then for vopt mode, vsim sometimes produces the following error message:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-3033) top.v(7): Instantiation of '/test/bug/lib3.ut_udp2(verilog)' failed. The design unit was not found.
</code>
<br>
This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
vlog would fail to read a design while issuing the error:<br>
<code>
 ... unexpected "end of source code".
</code>
</li>
<li>
Casting a parameter of string type to an integer type would sometimes produce a crash or give wrong results. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>
A continuous assignment having a variable driver delay behaved as if there was no delay in some cases if the assignment was from one vector net to another of equal width.</li>
<li>
Under certain circumstances (e.g. a method in a parameterized class, a forward typedef), vlog would print an invalid error about a field of a struct not being found.
</li>
<li>
Backslash characters would not be properly formatted within string literals in the output of vlog's <b>-E</b> option.
</li>
<li>
A non-wire connection to a module port net declared with a "net delay" simulated with zero delay in an optimized design if the module instance was inlined.</li>
<li>
An always block triggered by a hierarchical reference (or a structure field select) failed to trigger in some cases in an optimized SystemVerilog design.
</li>
<li>
An illegal assign to a void function name when the function is declared as extern caused a segmentation fault. This is now fixed.
</li>
<li>
In order to support SDF annotation of protected Verilog regions, $sdf_annotate calls that meet certain conditions are "hoisted" and treated as if they were specified on vsim command line. The conditions are that $sdf_annotate is either the first statement in a block or every statement preceding it is a built-in systask. (We used to allow user-defined systasks too. Now restricted to built-in systasks only).</li>
<li>
Continuous assignment to a wire from an untyped parameter might have resulted in a wrong value. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>
Assigning an interface-array formal port to a virtual interface could cause a runtime crash.</li>
<li>
Verilog or SystemVerilog string parameter overrides from the command line(<b>-G</b>/<b>-g</b>) can now be specified without double-quoting the string. For example <b>-Gstring_param=Hello</b>.
</li>
<li>
Using the <b>+initreg=u</b> switch to initialize UDP registers may cause incorrect simulation results.
</li>
<li>
NaN results from a divide-by-zero operation in a variable delay expression is not detected and properly reported.
</li>
<li>
vlog printed an internal error when a continuous assignment used a concatenation of individual bits of an enum variable.
</li>
<li>
The vsim command line option <b>+notimingchecks</b> may cause incorrect simulation result in an optimized sequential cell that models negative timing checks.
</li>
<li>
Simultaneous events did not always violate $hold and $recovery timing checks.</li>
<li>
Timing checks disabled with limits set to zero were not being used to solve delay net delays required by negative timing check limits.</li>
<li>
Fixed a $system() issues that only existed on Windows.
</li>
<li>
An event control having either a posedge or negedge on a part-select of a vector register incorrectly triggered when the edge occurred on bits other than the LSB of the part-select.</li>
<li>
If a replication operation with a zero replication multiplier appears inside a concatenation, it will be considered to be of size zero and ignored.</li>
<li>
An always block that assigned to a variable with a blocking assignment incorrectly re-queued the same always block for execution in some cases if the variable also appeared in the sensitivity list of the event control. While an always block is running, none of its event controls should be considered active.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
This release fixes some problems with the bits derived by VPI iteration on some classes of nets and ports. </li>
<li>
Some learn mode defects have been fixed. One defect caused the simulator to crash when the VPI application used the vpi_put_value() function under certain conditions. Another defect caused the simulator to crash for some SignalSpy usages.</li>
<li>
PLI/FLI shared objects that register exit callbacks using g_atexit() would sometime crash the simulator during quit. This is fixed now.</li>
<li>
The vpiScope and vpiModule transitions from VPI objects of type vpiGenScope are now available.</li>
<li>
Some issues getting VPI objects that are subcomponents of complex mixed unpacked/packed structs using vpi_handle_by_name() have been fixed.</li>
<li>
VPI assertion callback was not working correctly when assertion property was disabled by disable_iff construct. This has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Complex expressions in the binding indications of a component configuration
could be incorrectly optimized.</li>
<li>
The simulator could crash when elaborating a design with a subtype local to a function and in which the subtype refers to array attributes of the return value of that function.</li>
<li>
In some cases when VHDL blocks had generic maps with generic dependent port ranges and were used inside generates, a port mismatch error occurs. This is now fixed</li>
<li>
Some error conditions were not detected when a <b>force</b> command was applied to a
subelement of a composite port of mode in or inout. Error number 3456 is now
correctly issued in these cases. 
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when attempting to load a black box design with an optimized VHDL top-level design unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
mti_GetSignalSubelements would incorrectly report an error if the signal argument was a signal that did not contain any scalar signals.  A signal will not contain any scalar signals if it is an array of length 0 (NULL array) or is record with no fields or all the fields are NULL arrays. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
In VITAL memory models, some HOLD violations were incorrectly reported as SETUP violations, and some HOLD violations reported an incorrect state (High vs. Low).  This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for the SystemVerilog disable statement that involves DPI-SC calls.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="assertiondefects"></a><b>Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
vsim crashed when using boolean repeats with repeat count greater than 10000.</li>
<li>
vlog gave parsing error for valid embedded PSL code present in a module compiled with <b>-v</b> switch but not being used in the design.
</li>
<li>
Forward referencing in now supported in PSL.</li>
<li>
vlog gave error when concatenation operator '{var}' was used in PSL built-in functions.
</li>
<li>
Use of unclocked PSL built-in in abort expression caused vlog to give internal error.
</li>
<li>
The HTML report was not showing the Assertions Summary consistently with the
command <b>vcover stats</b> (the HTML report was only showing assertion successes).
Now it is consistent with <b>vcover stats</b>, and shows Assertion Passes and Assertion Failures.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Using SignalSpy to mirror the value of single-bit vectors at the SystemVerilog-VHDL boundary, e.g. VHDL std_logic_vector(4 to 4) to Verilog reg [0:0], would produce an incorrect type mismatch error. This has been fixed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Applying statement exclusions to entire source files used to ignore the <b>-item</b> argument. This is fixed now.
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug regarding exclusion report for "case" branches.</li>
<li>
A problem with clearing "case" branch bins exclusion in coverage view mode has been fixed.</li>
<li>
Fixed the possibility of a vsim crash when code coverage is on and a SystemVerilog
generate block contains an instance which is inlined. For the moment
we are inhibiting inlining of the instance within the generate block.
A full repair will not be possible in the 6.4x release sequence, but
will be included in a later release.
</li>
<li>
The GUI incorrectly highlighted portions of text when multiple Verilog statements were found on a single line of source.
</li>
<li>
HTML coverage reports can now be generated for the simulation dataset.</li>
<li>
The "View Coverage Details" item of popup menu in the Verification Management Tracker window is now disabled (grayed out) when the row selected has a type which has no coverage details.</li>
<li>
Excluded toggles incorrectly show up in HTML coverage reports. This is fixed.
</li>
<li>
The HTML summary report now shows the count of passing tests with warnings separately.</li>
<li>
Wrong toggle coverage statistics shown in Workspace window in simulation mode when some bits of a vector are excluded.</li>
<li>
The Missed Coverage window did not show the last "elsif" missed branch when "else" was absent in the branch.
</li>
<li>
A Missed expression was showing as a missed condition in viewcov mode when only FEC
of the expression was missed.
</li>
<li>
Merge produced incorrect toggle 0->Z transition counts.
</li>
<li>
VHDL process statements were not getting included in statement coverage. This was inconsistent with Verilog where we included always statements in statement coverage. Now VHDL process statements will appear in code coverage.</li>
<li>
Sometimes when compiling a design unit with <b>-cover bcesft</b>, which instantiates a
design unit compiled with <b>-cover bcesfx</b>, the following erroneous error would occur:
<br>
<code>
** Error: (vcom-1913) Ambiguous options bcesfx, toggle and extended toggle both specified.<p> This has been fixed.
</code>
</li>
<li>
 There are two different coverage flows: 
<ul>
The Manual Flow that includes toggle add/disable/enable.
</ul>
<ul>
The Compile/Simulator Flow that includes vsim coverage with coverage exclude.
</ul>

Fixed a problem when using the <b>toggle add</b> command from the first flow and then excluding nodes using the <b>coverage exclude</b> command from the second flow.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The string "(null)" appears in the transcript when some SignalSpy errors are suppressed. This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
vcover could crash when merging UCDB files for certain VHDL designs.  This has been corrected.
</li>
<li>
Attempting to add wave, list or log a VlTypedef would cause a crash.</li>
<li>
The Verilog API method for transaction recording, $begin_transaction(), failed to handle its "begin_time" parameter correctly.  The parameter was treated as if it were a 32-bit integer time.  This has been corrected.</li>
<li>
For the <b>-vcdstim</b> feature, ascending order buses (i.e. 0 to 31) could sometimes be reversed in the resulting vcdstim simulation.
</li>
<li>
Using checkpoint/restore with designs that use the built-in OVM library crash on restore or restart.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
In some cases under OVM, transaction streams were mis-named with the string passed as the "stream kind" parameter to $create_transaction_stream().  This has been corrected.</li>
<li>
The vmake utility generates combined make rules for Verilog design units when the source files are compiled with the same command line arguments. In some cases, the vlog command for the combined rule did not list all the source files.
</li>
<li>
Batch mode execution of dofiles containing <b>add wave</b> commands could fail to be replaced with the equivalent <b>log</b> commands. This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
When a library containing an optimized "black box" (bbox) design is moved to a new location, incorrect "file not found" errors were reported when a fatal error occurred.</li>
<li>
<b>-gen_xml</b> will function normally when the library and/or module files are read-only.
</li>
<li>
When using <b>-mixedansiports</b>, vlog continues to generate a warning.  Changed the handling (for -mixed cases ONLY) so the warning is suppressible by the customer.
</li>
<li>
Fixed problems with UCDB TESTSTATUS in simulation mode.</li>
<li>
Added exclusion information to the XML report.
</li>
<li>
Fixed problems with Generated HTML report and altered it to be more like GUI/tracker.
</li>
<li>
Fixed UCDB coverage save hang.</li>

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop at the breakpoint. </li>
<li>
On Windows platform, if breakpoint is set on a SystemC object destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which will prevent unloading of the shared library.</li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
vlog will now print an "unsupported" error message for nested design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3.  This error may be suppressed using the <b>-suppress 2230</b> command-line options.</li>
<li>
For viewing events in Expanded Time in the List window, use the "configure list" command with the "-delta events" option.  "events" is added to the "all", "collapse", and "none" options for the "-delta" argument.  These options control the details shown in the List window and in writing list files.  This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.

The "write list -events" command serves a different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control Expanded Time viewing in List window.

</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b>, <b>searchlog</b>, and <b>seetime</b> commands have NOT been enhanced
for use with Expanded Time.  This was documented incorrectly in the
"Expanded Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of the
"Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
</li>
<li>
If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of warning:<br>
# Loading mypackage(body) <br>
# Internal Warning in process_sub: failed to find local inlined subprogram 
called in pkg<br>
#     (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2<br>
#     Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram<br>
Then add the <b>-noFunctionInline</b> option to <b>vcom</b> for that package, 
or reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they are used.</li>
<li>
Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules, 
interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.</li>
<li>
Using the profiler on Solaris 8 can result in the error, "Setitimer: Permission denied."  To prevent this error, set the environment variable MTI_THREAD_DISABLE to 1. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The name of the <b>-totals</b> argument to the <b>vcover ranktest</b> and <b>coverage ranktest</b> commands has been changed to <b>-iterative</b>. Functionally, the arguments are identical.
</li>
<li>
In some cases the <b>-vmake</b> flag will be required to correctly capture Verilog source file dependencies.
</li>
<li>
The priority of <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> options is adjusted from the previous versions.  Now, the <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> options specified to vopt with design unit or instance name have the highest priority.  After that, these options applied to vlog have the next priority and the vopt <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> options have the last priority.  In earlier versions, the <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> options specified to vlog command had higher priority than design unit or instance specific <b>+initreg</b>/<b>+initmem</b> vopt options.
</li>
<li>
To improve usability, the Run toolbar has been changed: a Break button has been added.
</li>
<li>
The text-based windows (Transcript, Notepad and Source) now have an "inline" search bar (instead of a dialog box) which supports incremental searching. The previous behavior can be restored using the "Main/InlineTextSearch" option.</li>
<li>
Several fatal elaboration errors will now print the line # where the error occurred.</li>
<li>
The new enhanced support of analog format within the Wave window includes a change to the output created by "write format wave". In pre-6.4 the output for the "add wave" commands would include "-offset" and "-scale". Starting in 6.4 the output will instead use "-min" and "-max".</li>
<li>
When vpi_iterate and vpi_scan are used on an array of instances, the individual elements will now be returned left-to-right, where they formerly were returned low-to-high.  For example if they are applied to "mymodule u1[2:0]();", the elements returned will be u1[2], u1[1], u1[0].</li>
<li>
Each tag in a taglist (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
VCD extensions for SystemVerilog supported as per Section 24: VCD Data in IEEE-P1800.  LRM is not extending VCD for interfaces and programs. They will be dumped as "module" scope.</li>
<li>
The Source window has been changed to remove the separate column used to display breakpoints. Breakpoints will be shown within the "line number" column (as they were in the pre-6.3 releases). The LMB event handling has been improved to avoid inadvertent setting of breakpoints. Also, there is now a subtle visual separator bar between the text area and the line number column to help guide the user during text selection.
</li>
<li>
The coverage numbers shown in the source window can appear to be in conflict with what's shown in the "Missed Coverage" window. This occurs when the Missed Coverage window is in "By Instance" mode and the source window is in "By File" mode. The latter is the default for the source window but it gives no indication what its current mode is. To make it clear for the user, the title bar of the source window will be enhanced to include the current coverage data mode(either "by file" or "by instance").</li>
<li>
The Contains toolbar now supports multiple wildcard modes.  The default mode is now "glob" style which is the more common form of wildcards as found in UNIX shells.  The wildcards are *, ?, [chars], and \x where x is any character, removing that character's special meaning.  

<p>Previously, this filtering tool used full regular expressions.  This option is selectable from the menu button in the Contains entry box, by selecting the value "regular-expression".</p>

<p>The third option, "exact", does not use wildcards so no characters have any special meaning.</p>

<p>In all modes, the search patterns are considered case insensitive.  If a case sensitive pattern is needed, use the regular-expression mode and perpend the search string with "(?c)".</p>

<p>The preference variable PrefMain(ContainsMode) defines the filter mode for all windows with one of the values of "glob", "regexp", or "exact".</p>

<p>More information on regular expressions can be found in the Tcl reference manual under "re_syntax".  Information on glob style matching can be found in the Tcl reference manual under the "string match" command.</p></li>
<li>
Macro arguments to Verilog and SystemVerilog macros are now expanded prior to substitution into the macro body.
 </li>
<li>
SDF annotation of RECREM or SETUPHOLD matching only a single setup/hold/recovery/removal timing check will result in a warning message.</li>
<li>
The transaction recording engine no longer issues a warning if a design attempts to record a transaction of zero length.</li>
<li>
The log and nolog commands are now supported for transaction streams of all kinds.  TR streams created through the SCV or Verilog APIs have logging enabled by default.  The rule is that a transaction will be logged in WLF if logging is enabled at the simulation time when the design calls ::begin_transaction() or $begin_transaction.  The effective start time of the transaction (the time passed by the design as a parameter to beginning the transaction) does not matter.  Thus, a stream could have logging disabled between T1 and T2 and still record a transaction in that period using retroactive logging after time T2.  A transaction is always entirely logged or entirely ignored.</li>
<li>
PSL LTL and OBE operators are now disabled by default.  Use <b>-pslext</b> vcom/vlog/vopt switch to enable these operators.
</li>
<li>
The Win32/Win32PE platform executables (excluding vish.exe) are now linked with the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch. This switch allows an executable to allocate an extra gigabyte of process space (up to 3GB). The additional gigabyte of process space is available on Windows configurations that include the /3GB (/userva on Vista) boot switch.  Vish.exe is not linked with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE and we do not recommended that this switch be used with vish.exe.  Testing vish.exe with this switch exhibited a tendency to exceed the one GB system limitation which results in a crash.  When the simulator's GUI displays several windows with large amounts of graphical data and a full redraw occurs, a temporary surge in the allocation of system memory can cause the limit to be exceeded.
</li>
<li>
The behavior of virtual expressions has changed in a subtle way.  Normally when a virtual expression contains a relative context pathname, for example u1/x2/b, the current context would be used in order to resolve the name.  However, relative paths that started with a toplevel name would also be recognized, ignoring the current context.  This unintended behavior has been corrected so that the current context is always used to resolve a relative name.  This may cause some previously accepted virtual expressions to fail to be accepted.</li>
<li>
modules found through source library search are no longer treated by default as if they contained a `celldefine compiler directive. To obtain the old behavior, add +libcell to the vlog command line. Source library search is enabled with -v and -y compilation options.
Whether a module is considered a cell or not affects logging defaults with log -r *, coverage defaults within the module, and PLI access routines acc_next_cell and acc_next_cell_load. This change simplifies migration from other simulator products. </li>
<li>
Support for Verilog hierarchical references through VHDL design units has been
greatly improved. It is now possible for hierarchical references from a 
higher level Verilog to refer to objects in a Verilog module instantiated beneath a VHDL design unit.  In previous releases, upward references from a lower level Verilog module would only work if the target's scope was a direct parent, or a sibling that was instantiated lexically earlier in source. This restrictions are now removed. Hierarchical references that pass through a VHDL design will not work in the follow cases:
<ul>
<li> Is the target of a defparam.
<li> Used as an actual to a unconstrained VHDL port.
<li> Target of the reference is a VHDL object.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
A new toolbar has been added to the Wave window for access to the existing Bookmark functionality.</li>
<li>
Enabled use of the "contains" filter for the Files tab of the Workspace window.</li>
<li>
Support for some additional VPI features has been added in this release. The vpiDriver transition has been extended, and partial support for vpiContAssign objects has been added.</li>
<li>
When encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the encrypted Verilog file.
</li>
<li>
Wave searches initiated from the keyboard or toolbar buttons can now be stopped by clicking the Wave window's "Stop Wave Drawing" toolbar button or the Simulation toolbar's "Break" button.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog array manipulation methods now reflect the latest changes in the P1800 Draft5 version of the LRM, in that iteration occurs only in the top dimension of the array.  That is, the correct way to sum the elements of a 2-dimensional memory, as indicated in the LRM's example, is:
<p>
<br>logic [7:0] m [2][2] = '{ '{5, 10}, '{15, 20} };
<br>int y;
<br>y = m.sum with (item.sum with (item)); // y becomes 50 => 5+10+15+20
<p>
<br>Previously, ModelSim iterated through all the unpacked dimensions, "[2][2]" in this case.
</li>
<li>
When using the C-debugger to debug quit callback functions, the user needed to turn on 'stop on quit' mode. Users start debugging by issuing the <b>quit -f</b> command. When simulation the ends, the user needed to quit the C-debugger using <b>cdbg quit</b> and then the GUI using <b>quit -f</b>. Now, users do not need to issue extra commands at the end of the run. Simulator automatically quits the C-debugger and GUI, after debugging is done and the simulation has stopped running.
</li>
<li>
If a VHDL signal is read during elaboration the value read may differ from value read in previous releases.  The VHDL LRM considers this illegal(Section 12.3) but tool behavior has always been to just warn and allow a value to be read. What the value read has always been undefined. Additionally previous releases allowed
functions and procedure with signal parameter to be called during elaboration. This is now illegal and reported at compile time.</li>
<li>
The menus which control the functional coverage tab display options (assertion, cover directives and functional coverage) have changed slightly.  Most significant of the changes is that each pane now has a separate control for "Show All Contexts" and "Recursive Mode" that is not shared with the other panes.  They are available with the right mouse click popup window as well as under the tool's main menu, under the "Display Options" menu pick.</li>
<li>
The <b>bp</b> command now outputs a list of existing C breakpoints with their enabled/disabled states in the <b>bp</b> command syntax, so that this output can be saved and executed later to recreate the breakpoints. 
</li>
<li>
The effect of assertions on some coverage features has changed.  Because assertion pass counts were not reliable without <b>-assertdebug</b> used in simulation, pass counts have been removed from the coverage database and reports by default.  (With <b>-assertdebug</b>, they remain, along with other counts.)  Also, the contribution of assertions to total coverage, in the Verification Management Tracker and Browser,  has changed.  Previously, an assertion contributed to "100% coverage" if it non-vacuously passed at least once.  Now, with <b>-assertdebug</b>, "100% coverage" is met if an assertion both non-vacuously passed and never failed.  Without <b>-assertdebug</b>, "100% coverage" is met if the assertion never failed.  There is a new VM Browser column called "%SuccessAsserts" to indicate this statistic.  If assertions are included in a test plan, this statistic is automatically used in the VM Tracker and <b>coverage analyze</b> command.
</li>
<li>
Following modifications have been done to coverage switches:<br>
<br>
<TABLE BORDER="4" CELLPADDING="2"  CELLSPACING="2" WIDTH="50%">

</li>
<li>
Errors involving unpacked array assignment, where the packed elements do not match exactly (signed/unsigned, different widths, 2-state/4-state), may now be suppressed using '-suppress 7034'. </li>
<li>
The HTML report now shows the total number of covergroup bins per coverpoint or cross and, of those, how many were covered. This information appears on the covergroup details pages for each scope.</li>
<li>
When the simulation encounters an error during a run, a message will be displayed showing the file and line location of the error and the sequence of calls showing how it got there.  This is an extension of the Stopped At message displayed previously.  In GUI mode, this message may be used to view the file by double-clicking on the file name in the message.  This message may be suppressed by setting the PrefMain(noRunMsg) preference to 1.</li>
<li>
The assertion gui panel now will save the state of the display option settings when the simulation exits.</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>-title</b> switch can now be used with the <b>-load_elab</b> switch. Previously this option was disallowed.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.4d</b>
<ul>
<li>
When using the File > Open method to open a WLF log file, the contained signals were automatically added into a Wave window. A new Wave window preference has been added to control whether this "auto add" is done. The setting is accessed in the Preferences dialog, on the "By Name" page, in the "Wave" section. The name of the setting is "OpenLogAutoAddWave".
</li>
<li>
Added limited support for export function debugging of outoftheblue DPI-C call. One can set breakpoints in or step through export function during the execution of outoftheblue DPI-C call. However, this support is only limited in the outoftheblue DPI-C calls that are initiated from inside a SystemC thread or a SystemC method:
<br>
<UL>
<LI>To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated from inside a SystemC thread, vsim switch <b>-dpioutoftheblue 2</b> is needed. 
<LI>To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated from inside a SystemC method, Both vsim switch <b>-scdpidebug</b> and <b>-dpioutoftheblue 2</b> are needed.
</UL>
<br>
For any other kinds of outoftheblue DPI-C calls, no debugging support is available.
</li>
<li>
Transaction streams may be created with a full or relative path name.  If the path leads to an existing region, the stream will be created in that region.  The GUI icon for the stream depends on the region in which the stream appears.  (MVC streams do not follow this convention, having their own icons.)  To match a relative path, the tool may search upward from the calling region.  This change applies to streams created in SystemC, Verilog or SystemVerilog.  For example, "$create_transaction_stream(".top.dut.stream") will create a stream called "stream" in the region ".top.dut" if that region exists.
</li>
<li>
Added the <b>-dpiforceheader</b> switch to vlog/vopt/vsim commands to force generate DPI header even when empty of function prototypes.
</li>
<li>
The XML report [commands: <b>coverage report -xml</b> and <b>vcover report -xml</b>] was not showing test attributes in the case where the <b>-testattr</b> argument was passed.
<br>
Now the report is showing them surrounded by the XML tags 
&lt;test&gt;&lt;/test&gt; for each test.
