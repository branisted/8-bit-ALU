   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.6 Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the 5.6c release. If you are migrating to the 5.6c release from
       5.4 and earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6x and
       5.5x release notes for product changes and new features introduced
       during the 5.6 and 5.5 patch releases. The previous version
       release notes can be found in your modeltech installation at
       docs/rlsnotes.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are
       built on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX 10.20
       environment, you must use the hp700_1020 platform executables.
       Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0. For the hp700_1020
       version of vsim, shared libraries must be compiled and linked on
       HP-UX 10.20.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
       attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * There is a signature change in the 5.6b ieee math_real library. If
       you have a design that was compiled in 5.6 or 5.6a, which when
       loaded with 5.6b or greater vsim produces error messages similar
       to the following:
       # ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.testbench because
       modeltech/linux/../ieee.math_real has changed.
       # Error loading design
       then you need to recompile your design with 5.6c vcom. This change
       is a result of a bug fix to improve the accuracy of the
       representation of floating-point constants. See the 5.6b release
       notes under VHDL Defects Repaired for details.
     * WLF file format version has changed for 5.6c.
       Modelsim 5.6c will be able to read older WLF files.
       Modelsim 5.6b and earlier will NOT be able to read WLF files
       generated with 5.6c. The WLF format changes should improve
       reliability manipulating the wave/list windows while the
       simulation is running.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * ModelSim crashed when combining a large number of signals from the
       Wave window by selecting the signals in the Wave window and doing
       Tools->Combine Signals. Those selected signals are concatenated
       into a string and if that resulting string exceeded ~10,000
       characters, a crash occurred.
     * A searchlog done with the same starting and ending time did not
       report state changes that took place during deltas in that time
       step.
     * Bits and part selects of VHDL composite signals did not get
       re-logged following restart.
     * The command configure list -usesignaltrigger changed the value of
       the usesignaltrigger variable. However, write format list did not
       recognize this change.
     * In the Add Items to Project dialog, the Create Simulation button
       was incorrectly allowed to be activated multiple times
       simultaneously.
     * An error was generated while inserting a counter template in a
       Verilog Source window. After the wizard finished, an error dialog
       popped up with the following message: "Template verilog/count not
       found".
     * The WLF reader erroneously issued the following message (signal
       name and number may vary):
       # WLF Error: Unable to resolve type of signal alias "/top/u1/siga"
       (#313). Ignoring signal.
     * A WLF writer bug sometimes caused the Signals window to display
       -No Data- for all signals when viewing a WLF file.
     * When objects with extended identifier names were dragged into the
       Dataflow window the simulation hung.
     * The Waveform Examine window (which is invoked with a right
       click->Examine... on a waveform) and the Examine Popup (displayed
       by holding the mouse over a waveform) did not display record
       element names and array indexes but instead displayed line
       numbers.
     * Logging a port crashed the simulator if the following condtions
       were true.
          + In the instantation, named association was used for the port.
          + Subelement association was used and the formal was a slice
            that completely covered the formal.
          + The actual was a type conversion or conversion function.
     * Any attempt to display a Verilog Named Event in the Dataflow
       window crashed the simulator.
     * Waveform comparison failed to work properly with delayed virtual
       signals.
     * Libraries would incorrectly have the text "Not Available" by them
       in the Library window. This would occur if the physical pathname
       specified in the .ini/.mpf file contained environment variables of
       the form ${variable_name}.
     * The Signals window did not sort signals correctly when changing
       the current context. If the context had never been displayed, the
       signals were displayed in declaration order independently of the
       sort order selected. If the context was displayed previously, the
       ordering that was in effect when the signals were initially
       displayed was used.
     * Resizing the Wave window while waves were drawing sometimes caused
       a crash.
     * Signal name creation/selection did not work properly in the New
       Design Wizard.
     * The various compare commands that write to files failed if the
       pathname to the file contained a space.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * vlog did not check for recursive macro expansion (Mentor
       DR292044.)
     * Multiple VCD dumps of the same real variable caused a crash.
     * If you created a connectivity loop with zero-delay Verilog gates
       that did not settle out, the simulator crashed. (This situation
       should produce an "Iteration limit exceeded" error message. )
     * One-bit wide register values were sometimes incorrectly displayed.
       This occurred only when $display, $displayb, $displayo, or
       $displayh was used via the PLI pointer memoryval_p and the unused
       bits were filled with non-zero values.
     * In some cases, the ** (exponential) operator incorrectly swapped
       the base and exponent when the left-hand side operand was less
       than or equal to 32 bits.
     * SDF annotation of output to output interconnect delays sometimes
       failed if the primitive drivers of the port were lower in the
       hierarchy.
     * Delay net delay calculation for optimized cells was not adjusting
       delays associated with zero limit timing checks. This caused no
       solution possible warnings.
     * In the case of a no solution found warning for negative timing
       checks, the negative limits selected for zeroing could differ
       between optimized and non-optimized cells if two checks with the
       same negative limit value existed.
     * The simulator sometimes crashed during resolution of switch
       networks when the -fast option was used to compile a Verilog
       design containing switches.
     * In some situations the delay net delay calculator failed to find
       solutions for optimized cells.
     * Display of no solution messages for optimized (-fast) cells was
       suppressed when using the vsim option +nosdfwarn or the project
       file variable setting of IgnoreWarning = 1.
     * When using the +opt or -fast switch, if an instantiation
       referenced a local register through a hierarchical reference the
       following error would occur:
       "Internal error: vresolve.c:(180) is_net_decl(conn)".
       Example:
module x;
  reg y;
  instance z( x.y );
         // replacing x.y with y will remove the error
endmodule
     * Defining a parameter whose size was determined by another
       parameter whose value was determined by some operation could cause
       a "Defparam iteration limit of 10 exceeded" message to occur.
       Example:
module test2;

  parameter a = 64;
  parameter b = 2;
  parameter c = 600;
  parameter d = a + b + c;
  parameter [d:1] e = "hello";
  parameter [d:1] f = "goodbye";

initial begin
  #10
  $display( "d = %d", d );
  $display( "e = %s", e );
  $display( "f = %s", f );
end

endmodule
     * When using the wlf2log option -lower or -l, Verilog nets greater
       than one bit wide would be listed both as vectors and as
       individual bits. Verilog nets are now always listed only as
       vectors. The -bits option was added to force vector nets to be
       split into one-bit wide nets in the log file.
     * INOUT ports declared with the new Verilog 2001 "ANSI" style module
       declaration were incorrectly marked as outputs. In Verilog-only
       designs this does not cause problems. In a mixed design, the
       values driven on the port would not be shown on the Verilog side.
     * Any -y options that follow a -refresh option on a vlog command
       line will now be ignored. Any -y options that come before the
       -refresh option on a vlog command line will continue to be
       processed.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.6c
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * The keyword OPEN was not disallowed as a value for a signal
       parameter to a subprogram. Using the keyword in this way typically
       crashed the compiler. Now the compiler reports an error in this
       case.
     * The = operator on record types could incorrectly return FALSE. The
       hidden padding of records declared within subprogram scopes was
       initialized incorrectly. As a result, the = operator would find
       differences in the padding which were not visible to the user.
       Returning a record from a function or assigning to a record
       parameter in a procedure would cause the incorrect values in the
       padding of the record to propagate from variables in subprograms
       to variables in processes causing the = operator to fail on record
       variables not within a subprogram.
     * The use of 'range and 'reverse_range in a slice expression could
       be incorrectly optimized out. This occurred if the object being
       sliced had its bounds specified by the use of a 'range or
       'reverse_range attribute expression and the prefix for both
       attribute expressions was a parameter, generic, or port that had
       an unconstrained array type.
     * It was not permissible to specify a range_constraint in the form
       of a range_attribute_name (e.g., in a physical type definition.)
     * When using the -O5 switch in compiling VHDL, multiple uses of an
       array subscript or field of a record could result in corrupted
       generated code if the final use occurred within a conditional
       statement. When the corrupted code was loaded by the simulator,
       the simulator crashed.
     * Using the 'high attribute (or other similar attributes) on
       procedure or function parameters sometimes resulted in incorrect
       code being generated by the compiler, causing the simulation to
       crash.
     * If a package contained constant aggregate array declarations that
       were used within several entities and architectures declared
       within a single file, the compiler sometimes incorrectly generated
       code which accessed the constants within design units but only
       after the first design unit.
     * In version 5.6, an optimization was added to the VHDL compiler
       that finds variables receiving a single assignment in all
       control-flow paths of processes and procedures. This optimization
       did not correctly account for assignments to variables occurring
       in called procedures; hence, it was possible that certain
       variables would be converted to constants even though they
       received multiple assignments.
     * If the choice 'others' is given as a choice of a record aggregate,
       it must represent at least one element (See 1076-1993 7.3.2.1). If
       not, a warning message is required. No message was issued in this
       case.
     * Designs that used both std_logic_arith and numeric_bit packages
       sometimes produced incorrect results from the std_logic_arith
       functions.
     * Some type checking was missing for the case of slices.
     * Using the VHDL textio function writeline() to write a NULL line
       pointer to STD_OUTPUT did not result in a blank line being
       written. This defect first appeared in version 5.6.
     * The use of OTHERS in an aggregate qualified by an unconstrained
       array type was not detected as an error.
     * Short circuit operators with operand expressions that involve
       certain types of operations themselves (concatenation,
       std_logic_arith or numeric_[std|bit] function calls) sometimes
       crashed the simulator.
     * If the target of an assignment statement was a function call that
       didn't return an access type, vcom would incorrectly allow this
       assignment to pass.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.6c
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * Performing a restart while using VITAL multisource interconnect
       delays crashed the simulator.
     * VITAL memory models' data output signals were disabled when they
       should not have been. This was due to incorrect handling of the
       PortFlags record.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * Single-stepping through certain types of built-in processes (e.g.
       Verilog primitives, such as "and") did not work. Now
       single-stepping shows these types of processes.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.6c
     * The -incremental option to coverage reload was working only when
       used with -keep. Without -keep, the -incremental option was
       ignored and existing values were reset before loading the
       specified file.
     * vcd2wlf did not handle non-module VCD $scope types properly and
       created an unreadable .wlf file.
     * The space between extended VCD port names and their array indexes
       was not optional in VCD source files that were input to vcd2wlf
       and vsim -vcdstim.
     * vcd dumpports created one VCD port for all ports of a module that
       were part of the same collapsed net, regardless of the port
       direction or scope. vcd dumpports now creates one VCD port for all
       input ports and one VCD port for each output port that are part of
       the same collapsed net. Output ports may now have resolved values
       relative to their module that differ from the resolved value of
       the net.
     * The compare options -noaddwave and PrefCompare(defaultAddToWave)
       methods of disabling new compares were not added automatically to
       the Wave window in all cases. Previously this worked only when
       creating new compares via the GUI. Now it works correctly with the
       command compare add as well.
     * The time units of the compare add command were not correct when
       the command was called via the command line. (The GUI worked
       fine).
     * When using the signal attribute 'hasX in a searchlog expression,
       the search did not find X values that occurred as the initial
       value of a signal. This is because the initial value did not
       generate an event. The definition of the 'hasX attribute was
       changed from an Event attribute to a Value attribute, so that it
       will match the initial value case as well. The result type of
       'hasX was also changed from Event to Boolean.
     * On the rs6000 and rs64 platforms, if the break key (button) was
       pressed while FLI or PLI code was being executed, the simulator
       crashed.
     * A very long Wave window signal name caused a hang when sent to a
       printer or postscript file.
     * On Linux only, profiling crashed vsim with designs containing FLI
       or PLI shared object modules after a restart or after loading
       another design. This only happened with the following sequence:
       vsim design1; profile on; run...; profile report...;
       vsim design2 OR restart -f; profile on; run...; profile report...
     * The -nofilter option to the find command globally turned off
       filtering for the add list, log, and add wave commands.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.6c
     * DR 323585 - Vsim fails with fatal "bad pointer access" when
       running vhdl design.
     * DR 292044 - Recursive 'define should be caught by vlog...leads to
       memory allocation failure.
     * DR 325349 - Empty line not written out.
     * DR 298980 - This release contains an update to MGC licensing. When
       the LM_LICENSE_FILE and MGLS_LICENSE_FILE variables had duplicate
       settings mgls_asynch did not exit properly.
     * DR 325439 - Verilog2001 problem with exponential operator.
     * DR 323640 - -fast error message when compiling in 5.6, 5.6a but OK
       in 5.5.
     * DR 322749 - Error: (vsim-SDF-3250) top.sdf(14): Failed to find
       INSTANCE.
     * DR 325181 - Multiple checks for -y argument can slow refresh.
     * DR 325993 - modelsim.ini file hitting a limit and not reading in
       all of the mapped libraries.
     * DR 322921 - Refreshing libraries with the -quiet switch doesn't
       always work consistently.
     * DR 284575 - Tcl command no longer works in ModelSim.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Known Defects in 5.6c
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Product Changes to 5.6c
     * In GUI expressions, the possible and valid values for a boolean
       type are now restricted to TRUE and FALSE. It is no longer legal
       to specify the value 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE.
     * Starting with version 5.6, ModelSim no longer uses the tcl fonts
       during an X-session. It uses whatever is defined in the .Xdefaults
       file. This may cause problems for Exceed users. To ensure that the
       fonts look correct when running through Exceed, create a
       .Xdefaults file with the following lines:
          + vsim*Font: 10x13
          + vsim*SystemFont: 10x13
          + vsim*StandardFont: 10x13
          + vsim*MenuFont: 10x13
       Also, the following command can be used to update the X resources
       if you make changes to the .Xdefaults and wish to use those
       changes on a Linux/UNIX machine:
    xrdb -merge .Xdefaults
     * For ModelSim PE only, changes were made to allow viewing of .wlf
       files in a license neutral manner. For example, Verilog .wlf files
       can be viewed using any one of: Viewer, pe-vsim, or pe-vsim-vlog
       license features.
     * WLF file format version has changed for 5.6c.
       Modelsim 5.6c will be able to read older WLF files.
       Modelsim 5.6b and earlier will NOT be able to read WLF files
       generated with 5.6c. The WLF format changes should improve
       reliability manipulating the wave/list windows while the
       simulation is running.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   New Features Added to 5.6c
     * Added vsim command line switch -elab_defer_fli, for use with
       -elab, to defer the initialization of FLI models until the load
       of the elaboration file. This switch should be used to create
       elaboration files for designs with FLI models that don't support
       checkpoint and restore commands. Note that FLI models sensitive
       to design load ordering may not work correctly.
     * The source file name is now displayed in error messages whenever
       possible.
     * Waveform comparison can now delay an entire dataset with respect
       to another. A dataset can be delayed by using one of two new
       options to the compare start command. The options are:
        -refDelay delay
        -testDelay delay
       The first delays the reference dataset and the second delays the
       test dataset. If the delay contains a unit, it must be enclosed in
       curly braces.
       Delays are applied to signals specified with the compare add
       command. For each signal compared, a delayed virtual signal is
       created with "_d" appended to the signal name, and these are the
       signals viewed in the Wave window comparison objects.
       The delay is not applied to signals specified in compare "when"
       expressions.
