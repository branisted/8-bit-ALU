<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
forward from 5.6 Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See
"Regenerating your libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
more information on refreshing your models.

</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
the 5.6c release. If you are migrating to the 5.6c release from
5.4 and earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6x and
5.5x release notes for product changes and new features introduced
during the 5.6 and 5.5 patch releases. The previous version
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation at
docs/rlsnotes.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are built
on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX 10.20 environment, you 
must use the hp700_1020 platform executables. Please note that in order for 
FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 
version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0. For the 
hp700_1020 version of vsim, shared libraries must be compiled and linked on
HP-UX 10.20.


</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message
similar to "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00".
Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.


</li>
<li>
There is a signature change in the 5.6b ieee math_real library. If
you have a design that was compiled in 5.6 or 5.6a, which when
loaded with 5.6b or greater vsim produces error messages similar to the 
following:<br>
# ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.testbench because
modeltech/linux/../ieee.math_real has changed.<br>
# Error loading design<br>
then you need to recompile your design with 5.6c vcom.
This change is a result of a bug fix to improve the accuracy of
the representation of floating-point constants. See the 5.6b release notes
under VHDL Defects Repaired for details.



</li>
<li>
WLF file format version has changed for 5.6c.
<p>
Modelsim 5.6c will be able to read older WLF files.
<p>
Modelsim 5.6b and earlier will NOT be able to read
WLF files generated with 5.6c.  The WLF format
changes should improve reliability manipulating the
wave/list windows while the simulation is running.
</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
ModelSim crashed when combining a large number of signals from the Wave window 
by selecting the signals in the Wave window and doing Tools->Combine Signals.
Those selected signals are concatenated into a string and if that
resulting string exceeded ~10,000 characters, a crash occurred.
</li>
<li>
A searchlog done with the same starting and ending time did not report state 
changes that took place during deltas in that time step.
</li>
<li>
Bits and part selects of VHDL composite signals did not
get re-logged following restart.
</li>
<li>
The command <b>configure list -usesignaltrigger</b> changed the value of the 
usesignaltrigger variable. However, <b>write format list</b> did not recognize
this change.
</li>
<li>
In the Add Items to Project dialog, the Create Simulation button was
incorrectly allowed to be activated multiple times simultaneously.
</li>
<li>
An error was generated while inserting a counter template in a Verilog
Source window. After the wizard finished, an error dialog popped up with the
following message: "Template verilog/count not found".
</li>
<li>
The WLF reader erroneously issued the following message 
(signal name and number may vary):<br>
<code>
# WLF Error: Unable to resolve type of signal alias "/top/u1/siga" (#313). 
Ignoring signal.
</code>

</li>
<li>
A WLF writer bug sometimes caused the Signals window to display
-No Data- for all signals when viewing a WLF file.

</li>
<li>
When objects with extended identifier names were dragged into the Dataflow 
window the simulation hung.
</li>
<li>
The Waveform Examine window (which is invoked with a right click->Examine... on
a waveform) and the Examine Popup (displayed by holding the mouse over a
waveform) did not display record element names and array indexes but instead
displayed line numbers.
</li>
<li>
Logging a port crashed the simulator if the following condtions were true.
<UL>
<LI>
In the instantation, named association was used for the port.
<LI>
Subelement association was used and the formal was a slice that completely 
covered the formal.
<LI>
The actual was a type conversion or conversion function.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Any attempt to display a Verilog Named Event in the Dataflow window
crashed the simulator.

</li>
<li>
Waveform comparison failed to work properly with delayed virtual
signals.
</li>
<li>
Libraries would incorrectly have the text "Not Available" by them in the
Library window.  This would occur if the physical pathname specified in
the .ini/.mpf file contained environment variables of the form
${variable_name}.

</li>
<li>
The Signals window did not sort signals correctly when changing the current
context. If the context had never been displayed, the signals were displayed
in declaration order independently of the sort order selected. If the context 
was displayed previously, the ordering that was in effect when the signals 
were initially displayed was used.
</li>
<li>
Resizing the Wave window while waves were drawing sometimes caused a crash.

</li>
<li>
Signal name creation/selection did not work properly in the New Design Wizard.
</li>
<li>
The various <b>compare</b> commands that write to files failed if the pathname
to the file contained a space.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>vlog</b> did not check for recursive macro expansion (Mentor DR292044.)
</li>
<li>
Multiple VCD dumps of the same real variable caused a crash.
</li>
<li>
If you created a connectivity loop with zero-delay Verilog gates that
did not settle out, the simulator crashed.
(This situation should produce an "Iteration limit exceeded"
error message.  )
</li>
<li>
One-bit wide register values were sometimes incorrectly displayed. This
occurred only when $display, $displayb, $displayo, or $displayh was used via the
PLI pointer memoryval_p and the unused bits were filled with non-zero values.
</li>
<li>
In some cases, the ** (exponential) operator incorrectly swapped the base and 
exponent when the left-hand side operand was less than or equal to 32 bits.

</li>
<li>
SDF annotation of output to output interconnect delays sometimes failed if the
primitive drivers of the port were lower in the hierarchy.

</li>
<li>
Delay net delay calculation for optimized cells was not adjusting delays 
associated with zero limit timing checks. This caused no solution possible 
warnings.
</li>
<li>
In the case of a no solution found warning for negative timing checks,
the negative limits selected for zeroing could differ between optimized
and non-optimized cells if two checks with the same negative limit value
existed.
</li>
<li>
The simulator sometimes crashed during resolution of switch networks when the 
<b>-fast</b> option was used to compile a Verilog design containing switches.

</li>
<li>
In some situations the delay net delay calculator failed to find solutions for 
optimized cells.
</li>
<li>
Display of no solution messages for optimized (<b>-fast</b>) cells was 
suppressed when using the vsim option <b>+nosdfwarn</b> or the project file 
variable setting of IgnoreWarning = 1.
</li>
<li>
When using the <b>+opt</b> or <b>-fast</b> switch, if an instantiation 
referenced a local register through a hierarchical reference the following 
error would occur:<br>
<code>
"Internal error: vresolve.c:(180) is_net_decl(conn)".<br>
</code><br>
Example:<br><br>
<pre>
module x;
  reg y;
  instance z( x.y );
         // replacing x.y with y will remove the error
endmodule
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Defining a parameter whose size was determined by another parameter whose
value was determined by some operation could cause a "Defparam iteration
limit of 10 exceeded" message to occur.<br><br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
module test2;

  parameter a = 64;
  parameter b = 2;
  parameter c = 600;
  parameter d = a + b + c;
  parameter [d:1] e = "hello";
  parameter [d:1] f = "goodbye";

initial begin
  #10
  $display( "d = %d", d );
  $display( "e = %s", e );
  $display( "f = %s", f );
end

endmodule
</pre>

</li>
<li>
When using the wlf2log option -lower or -l, Verilog nets greater than
one bit wide would be listed both as vectors and as individual bits.
Verilog nets are now always listed only as vectors.  The -bits option
was added to force vector nets to be split into one-bit wide nets in the log
file.
</li>
<li>
INOUT ports declared with the new Verilog 2001 "ANSI" style module declaration
were incorrectly marked as outputs. In Verilog-only designs this does not
cause problems.  In a mixed design, the values driven on the port would
not be shown on the Verilog side.
</li>
<li>
Any <b>-y</b> options that follow a <b>-refresh</b> option on a vlog command 
line will now be ignored. Any <b>-y</b> options that come before the 
<b>-refresh</b> option on a vlog command line will continue to be processed.

</li>

<ul>
<li>
The keyword OPEN was not disallowed as a value for a signal parameter to a 
subprogram. Using the keyword in this way typically crashed the compiler. 
Now the compiler reports an error in this case.

</li>
<li>
The <b>=</b> operator on record types could incorrectly return FALSE.
The hidden padding of records declared within subprogram scopes was
initialized incorrectly.  As a result, the <b>=</b> operator would find
differences in the padding which were not visible to the user.  Returning
a record from a function or assigning to a record parameter in a procedure
would cause the incorrect values in the padding of the record to propagate
from variables in subprograms to variables in processes causing the <b>=</b>
operator to fail on record variables not within a subprogram.
</li>
<li>
The use of 'range and 'reverse_range in a slice expression could be incorrectly
optimized out. This occurred if the object being sliced had its bounds
specified by the use of a 'range or 'reverse_range attribute expression
and the prefix for both attribute expressions was a parameter, generic, or
port that had an unconstrained array type.
</li>
<li>
It was not permissible to specify a range_constraint in the form of a 
range_attribute_name (e.g., in a physical type definition.)
</li>
<li>
When using the <b>-O5</b> switch in compiling VHDL, multiple uses of an array 
subscript or field of a record could result in corrupted generated code if the 
final use occurred within a conditional statement. When the corrupted code was 
loaded by the simulator, the simulator crashed.
</li>
<li>
Using the 'high attribute (or other similar attributes) on procedure or
function parameters sometimes resulted in incorrect code being generated by the
compiler, causing the simulation to crash.
</li>
<li>
If a package contained constant aggregate array declarations that were used 
within several entities and architectures declared within a single file, the 
compiler sometimes incorrectly generated code which accessed the constants 
within design units but only after the first design unit.
</li>
<li>
In version 5.6, an optimization was added to the VHDL compiler that finds
variables receiving a single assignment in all control-flow paths of processes
and procedures. This optimization did not correctly account for assignments to
variables occurring in called procedures; hence, it was possible that certain
variables would be converted to constants even though they received multiple
assignments.
</li>
<li>
If the choice 'others' is given as a choice of a record aggregate, it must 
represent at least one element (See 1076-1993 7.3.2.1). If not, a warning 
message is required. No message was issued in this case. 
</li>
<li>
Designs that used both std_logic_arith and numeric_bit packages sometimes 
produced incorrect results from the std_logic_arith functions.
</li>
<li>
Some type checking was missing for the case of slices.
</li>
<li>
Using the VHDL textio function writeline() to write a NULL line pointer
to STD_OUTPUT did not result in a blank line being written.  This defect
first appeared in version 5.6.

</li>
<li>
The use of OTHERS in an aggregate qualified by an unconstrained array
type was not detected as an error.

</li>
<li>
Short circuit operators with operand expressions that involve certain
types of operations themselves (concatenation, std_logic_arith or 
numeric_[std|bit] function calls) sometimes crashed the simulator.
</li>
<li>
If the target of an assignment statement was a function call that didn't
return an access type, vcom would incorrectly allow this assignment to
pass.
</li>

<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Performing a <b>restart</b> while using VITAL multisource interconnect delays
crashed the simulator.
</li>
<li>
VITAL memory models' data output signals were disabled when they should not
have been. This was due to incorrect handling of the PortFlags record.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.6c</b>

<li>
Single-stepping through certain types of built-in processes
(e.g. Verilog primitives, such as "and") did not work. Now single-stepping 
shows these types of processes.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>-incremental</b> option to <b>coverage reload</b> was working only when 
used with <b>-keep</b>. Without <b>-keep</b>, the <b>-incremental</b> option 
was ignored and existing values were reset before loading the specified file.
</li>
<li>
vcd2wlf did not handle non-module VCD $scope types properly and created an 
unreadable .wlf file.
</li>
<li>
The space between extended VCD port names and their array indexes was not
optional in VCD source files that were input to <b>vcd2wlf</b> and 
<b>vsim -vcdstim</b>.
</li>
<li>
<b>vcd dumpports</b> created one VCD port for all ports of a module that were
part of the same collapsed net, regardless of the port direction or scope.
<b>vcd dumpports</b> now creates one VCD port for all input ports and
one VCD port for each output port that are part of the same collapsed net.
Output ports may now have resolved values relative to their module that differ
from the resolved value of the net.
</li>
<li>
The <b>compare options -noaddwave</b> and PrefCompare(defaultAddToWave) methods
of disabling new compares were not added automatically to the Wave window in all
cases. Previously this worked only when creating new compares via the GUI. Now 
it works correctly with the command <b>compare add</b> as well.
</li>
<li>
The time units of the <b>compare add</b> command were not
correct when the command was called via the command line.
(The GUI worked fine). 
</li>
<li>
When using the signal attribute 'hasX in a searchlog expression, the search 
did not find X values that occurred as the initial value of a signal.  This is 
because the initial value did not generate an event. The definition of the 
'hasX attribute was changed from an Event attribute to a Value attribute, 
so that it will match the initial value case as well. The result type of 
'hasX was also changed from Event to Boolean.
</li>
<li>
On the rs6000 and rs64 platforms, if the break key (button) was pressed while
FLI or PLI code was being executed, the simulator crashed.
</li>
<li>
A very long Wave window signal name caused a hang when sent to a printer 
or postscript file.
</li>
<li>
On Linux only, profiling crashed vsim with designs containing FLI or PLI
shared object modules after a restart or after loading another design.
This only happened with the following sequence:<br>
vsim design1; profile on; run...; profile report...;<br>
vsim design2 OR restart -f; profile on; run...; profile report...<br>

</li>
<li>
The <b>-nofilter</b> option to the <b>find</b> command globally turned off
filtering for the <b>add list</b>, <b>log</b>, and <b>add wave</b> commands.

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
In GUI expressions, the possible and valid values for a boolean type 
are now restricted to TRUE and FALSE. It is no longer legal to specify the
value 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE.
</li>
<li>
Starting with version 5.6, ModelSim no longer uses the tcl fonts during an
X-session. It uses whatever is defined in the .Xdefaults file. This may
cause problems for Exceed users. To ensure that the fonts look correct when
running through Exceed, create a .Xdefaults file with the following lines:
<p>
<ul>
<li>vsim*Font: 10x13</li>
<li>vsim*SystemFont: 10x13</li>
<li>vsim*StandardFont: 10x13</li>
<li>vsim*MenuFont: 10x13</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, the following command can be used to update the X resources if you make
changes to the .Xdefaults and wish to use those changes on a Linux/UNIX
machine:
<p>
<pre>
    xrdb -merge .Xdefaults
</pre>

</li>
<li>
For ModelSim PE only, changes were made to allow viewing of .wlf files in a 
license neutral manner. For example, Verilog .wlf files can be viewed using any
one of: Viewer, pe-vsim, or pe-vsim-vlog license features.
</li>
<li>
WLF file format version has changed for 5.6c.
<p>
Modelsim 5.6c will be able to read older WLF files.
<p>
Modelsim 5.6b and earlier will NOT be able to read
WLF files generated with 5.6c.  The WLF format
changes should improve reliability manipulating the
wave/list windows while the simulation is running.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 5.6c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added <b>vsim</b> command line switch <b>-elab_defer_fli</b>, for use with
<b>-elab</b>, to defer the initialization of FLI models until the load of the
elaboration file.  This switch should be used to create elaboration
files for designs with FLI models that don't support <b>checkpoint</b> and
<b>restore</b> commands. Note that FLI models sensitive to design load ordering
may not work correctly.
</li>
<li>
The source file name is now displayed in error messages whenever possible.

</li>
<li>
Waveform comparison can now delay an entire dataset with respect to another.
A dataset can be delayed by using one of two new options to the 
<b>compare start</b> command. The options are:<br>
<pre>
	-refDelay delay
	-testDelay delay
</pre>
The first delays the reference dataset and the second delays the test
dataset. If the delay contains a unit, it must be enclosed in curly braces.
<br><br>
Delays are applied to signals specified with the <b>compare add</b>
command. For each signal compared, a delayed virtual signal is created
with "_d" appended to the signal name, and these are the signals viewed
in the Wave window comparison objects.<br><br>
The delay is not applied to signals specified in compare "when" expressions.
