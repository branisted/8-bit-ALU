<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
<br>
The support includes the following platforms:
<br>
<ul>
<li>32-bit linux
<li>64-bit linux_x86_64 
</ul>
<p>
For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under the section Supported platforms.</li>
<li>
The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Windows 98
<li>Windows ME
<li>Windows NT 4.0
<li>Solaris 2.6
<li>Solaris 7
<li>AIX 4.3
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.

<UL>Solaris 10 has the following limitations:

<LI>In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between 20ms and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error message, "Too few samples."  To workaround this problem, add the following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:<br>
set hires_tick=1<br>
This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris releases.
<LI>In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the system and produce a messages like "nfs server array not responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6296698.
<LI>In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any  PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will break under Solaris 10.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 6.0x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is supported.  Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches <b>-87</b>, <b>-93</b>, or <b>-2002</b>, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>
The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5; Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
<p>
CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
<p>
For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software
being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
(i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
need to do anything.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit() task.</li>
<li>
The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit" variable in the modelsim.ini file.  By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.  The default time unit in SystemC can also be set using the sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like sc_clock or sc_time is created.</li>
<li>
vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar to the vsim command line options.</li>
<li>
Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option
has changed behavior somewhat.  This primarily affects
win32 and rs6000 users.

<OL>
<LI>You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename.
   That will be done for you automatically now.</LI>

<LI>There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'"
   to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line.</LI>
</OL>
The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat
files have been modified to show the correct flow now.
</li>
<li>
Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher will not
run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:<br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).<br>
# Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled<br>
# version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library<br>
# was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make<br>
# sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.<br>
</code></li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1d</b>
<ul>
<li>
When the <b>vsim -dpiexportobj</b> command was issued in the GUI, it completed successfully, but left the GUI in an incorrect state.  The "sim" tab was still present in the Workspace area, and the File -&gt; Open menu didn't work.</li>
<li>
The <b>-vopt</b> compile option was not saved in the modelsim.ini file.</li>
<li>
The Waveform Compare RMB (Right Mouse Button) popup menu would not operate in the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Error messages were generated after closing undocked windows.
</li>
<li>
The file modified indicator ("*") for the Source window was lost when the Source window was undocked and then re-docked.</li>
<li>
The "Add Log" menu item in the Objects window's popup menu was always greyed out.</li>
<li>
The <b>view wave</b> command incorrectly activated that last opened Wave window, not the first Wave window (named "wave").  Consequently, there was no way to activate the first Wave window from the command line.</li>
<li>
A WLF cache error caused intermittent crashing while manipulating the Wave window while the simulator was running. This only occurred when WLF caching was enabled; it is off by default.</li>
<li>
The Missed Coverage window displayed incorrect line information when a module was composed of multiple files. Now all statements from all file are displayed under the first file.</li>
<li>
The break button has improved ability to interrupt loops.</li>
<li>
Tcl error while expanding covergroups items in Covergroups browser
when the value of option.goal is 0.</li>
<li>
Wave window toolbar buttons were not activated until an action was taken or window was undocked. </li>
<li>
There was a problem with object deletion using the <b>virtual</b> commands.</li>
<li>
The vopt compiler option is not supported in PE, however, the compile dialog listed the option. Now the vopt option is only visible in product version that support it.  </li>
<li>
Hovering with the mouse on the Source window generate PLI errors.</li>
<li>
The Wave window won't respond to keyboard commands.</li>
<li>
Dataflow window memory requirements have been reduced and performance improved by optimization of dataflow query algorithms.</li>
<li>
Dataflow window sometimes did not provide a complete view of a signal for mixed VHDL-Verilog designs.</li>
<li>
During C Debug Init mode operation, RPC-blocked-1 messages were not caught when the simulate menu was activated.</li>
<li>
There were two problems searching in the Wave and List windows for signal values of vectors. First, if the radix was set by the <b>radix</b>
command, rather than directly clicking on the signal, the search failed
to properly interpret the target value. Secondly, if the radix were set to
decimal or unsigned, the initial target value was displayed in double quotes,
which caused the evaluator to fail. </li>
<li>
The "wlfman profile" report did not include the last object logged.</li>
<li>
In certain cases the "wlfman filter" operation generated redundant events when optimized.  This caused display errors at large zoom ranges when displaying a filtered WLF file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Short-circuit operators failed to short-circuit in some cases where an operand was a class member reference of a class object that was not allocated, resulting in a crash during simulation.</li>
<li>
Timing check conditions on module input ports with SDF annotated delays could be incorrectly evaluated.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog designs with DPI export tf's errored out during elaboration if a non-standard work library was used (i.e. the work library is not named "work").</li>
<li>
Module instance parameters failed to propagate correctly in some cases where the module was instantiated underneath a generate scope and where the parameter type itself depended on another parameter.</li>
<li>
Calling system functions from within tasks or functions defined in a SystemVerilog package caused the simulator to crash while loading the package.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed if a design contained both VHDL foreign subprograms and SystemVerilog DPI import tf's.</li>
<li>
A Verilog parameter value being overridden by a generic with a hexidecimal integer value containing an "E" was treated as a real instead of an integer.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed in some situations where $swrite was called before an assignment to a bit-select by a hierarchical reference.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog designs that had interdependent packages or dependencies on $unit  compiled successfully but vsim issued an error similar to:<BR>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.MultiPkg2 because work.MultiPkg2Pkg2 has changed.
</code></li>
<li>
vopt sometimes computed package dependencies incorrectly if you had mutiple interdependent packages or packages dependent on $unit. vopt issued an error similar to:<BR>
<code>
# ** Error: (vopt-7) Failed to open data file "work/_opt/work_test_sv_unit_fast.dt2" in read mode.
</code></li>
<li>
Verilog functions called to perform a bit-select with constant arguments (e.g., "data[fn(1)]") incorrectly reported an error if the function did not qualify as a constant function.</li>
<li>
The <b>+nowarn&lt;number&gt;</b> option did not fully suppress certain messages.</li>
<li>
vlog now allows whitespace between the macro name and the parenthesis when the macro is used.</li>
<li>
A restart on a design containing $fmonitor crashed the simulator in certain cases.</li>
<li>
In some SystemVerilog designs, bit-vector ports were mistakenly driven as 4-state values. This caused the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
Execution of a recursive task or function call was skipped in some unusual cases in an optimized design.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when assert property was inlined.</li>
<li>
System functions $fscanf() and $sscanf() now conform to the LRM more closely.</li>
<li>
The keyword "unsigned" is not valid anywhere in the 2001 syntax. Now a
warning is issued if it's encountered.</li>
<li>
The exponent operator previously give incorrect result for more than 32-bit wide bit-type variables.</li>
<li>
When a SystemVerilog associative array with a string key was assigned to another associative array with a string key, the compiler erroneously claimed that the array keys did not match.  This happened when the target variable was not in the same package as the source.</li>
<li>
Interactions between generates and package types caused compiler assertions.</li>
<li>
Instanciations of optimized gate-level cells under SystemVerilog with port connections to registers did not function correctly and caused a simulation crash in certain cases.</li>
<li>
Indexed access to an empty queue declared within an interface caused a stacktrace. The access is now trapped, and error message "Null instance dereference" is issued.</li>
<li>
Compiling a SystemVerilog source file that imports packages from different libraries sometimes failed to find some of the packages.</li>
<li>
When optimizing designs containing a mix of Verilog and SystemVerilog files, the Verilog source file was sometimes optimized as a SystemVerilog source file thus causing syntax errors when SystemVerilog keywords were used as regular identifiers.</li>
<li>
The vlog compiler crashed when compiling multiple SystemVerilog source files containing declarations in $unit scope when the <b>-mfcu</b> (multi-file compilation unit) option was used in conjunction with a libmap that targeted different libraries for some design units.</li>
<li>
Performing a non-blocking assignment with an "iff" clause (for example: "wdata <= @(posedge clk iff ready) 1'b1") caused the simulator to crash.</li>

<li>
In some cases, aliases dependent on generics caused a crash.</li>
<li>
The VHDL compiler and simulator now correctly handles disconnection (assignment of NULL) to subprogram signal parameters.
<UL>
<LI>vcom produces a syntax error if the declaration of a signal parameter includes the words BUS or REGISTER. This error can be overridden or suppressed by a command line option or a change to the modelsim.ini file.
<LI>The simulator checks during runtime that a disconnected signal is a BUS or a REGISTER and issues an error if it is not.
</UL></li>
<li>
A driving NULL array signal was not ignored in some cases and caused the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
Use of the 'simple_name, 'path_name, or 'instance_name attribute caused memory corruption and a potential crash.</li>
<li>
The misuse of the VHDL 1993 report keyword in VHDL 1987 outside an assert statement is now identified by the tool.
</li>
<li>
The compiler crashed with signal 11 when analyzing code containing
a globally static slice range used in a concurrent signal assignment
statement expression appearing immediately in an architecture statement
part (or in a slice name appearing in a sensitivity list of a process
statement) followed by an identical range used in the subtype indication
of a constant declaration appearing in a subprogram declaration region.</li>
<li>
Certain PSL expressions involving boolean types caused the compiler to crash in certain cases.  </li>
<li>
vcom crashed with a signal 11 during an array index computation.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed on 64-bit platforms when arrays of access types were compiled withot optimization (<b>-O0</b> was specified).</li>
<li>
The compiler generated bad code when a locally static error involving a string literal that had array index bounds that did not belong to the array index subtype was present in the statements in a GENERATE block.</li>

When the <b>coverage off</b> source code pragma was used, conditions and
expressions were not properly ignored. They were processed as if code coverage
were still on.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage save</b> command was not properly saving instances that contained
only other instances and no RTL code. This caused those instances to not be
available in vcover. </li>
<li>
The <b>-strip</b> option to <b>coverage reload</b> and <b>vcover</b> was not
properly skipping data in some cases in which the data needed to be skipped.</li>
<li>
The output from a <b>coverage report</b> command with the <b>-zeros</b> switch now includes the file name(s) and line numbers(s) of the code of interest.</li>
<li>
<b>vcover</b> would fail if the <b>-strip</b> option skipped a region that contained a toggle signal of type enum or integer.</li>
<li>
In some cases, generate instances with parameterized signal widths caused a fatal
assertion in vsim when code coverage was on and the parameterized signals
were included in toggle coverage. This has been changed to give a warning 
that the signals for some instances are not included in the design unit
summary because the widths are different.</li>
<li>
<b>vcover report -bydu  -xml </b> incorrectly included HDL source text in the XML file that it generated.</li>

This is a reminder that <b>code coverage</b> does not do short circuit evaluation
of <b>if</b> conditions. So if you turn on condition coverage and you get a crash,
that is the first thing you should check.</li>

The SDF error and warning messages will now print additional information, such as module name, source file name and line number, about the targeted module, when
<b>+sdf_verbose</b> has been specified on the vsim command line. In the vopt flow some of this new information may not be accurate due to information lost in the optimizations.
