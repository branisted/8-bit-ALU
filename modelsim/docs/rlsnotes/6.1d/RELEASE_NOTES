   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1d
     * When the vsim -dpiexportobj command was issued in the GUI, it completed
       successfully, but left the GUI in an incorrect state. The "sim" tab was
       still present in the Workspace area, and the File -> Open menu didn't
       work.
     * The -vopt compile option was not saved in the modelsim.ini file.
     * The Waveform Compare RMB (Right Mouse Button) popup menu would not
       operate in the Wave window.
     * Error messages were generated after closing undocked windows.
     * The file modified indicator ("*") for the Source window was lost when
       the Source window was undocked and then re-docked.
     * The "Add Log" menu item in the Objects window's popup menu was always
       greyed out.
     * The  view wave command incorrectly activated that last opened Wave
       window, not the first Wave window (named "wave"). Consequently, there
       was no way to activate the first Wave window from the command line.
     * A WLF cache error caused intermittent crashing while manipulating the
       Wave window while the simulator was running. This only occurred when WLF
       caching was enabled; it is off by default.
     * The Missed Coverage window displayed incorrect line information when a
       module was composed of multiple files. Now all statements from all file
       are displayed under the first file.
     * The break button has improved ability to interrupt loops.
     * Tcl error while expanding covergroups items in Covergroups browser when
       the value of option.goal is 0.
     * Wave window toolbar buttons were not activated until an action was taken
       or window was undocked.
     * There was a problem with object deletion using the virtual commands.
     * The vopt compiler option is not supported in PE, however, the compile
       dialog listed the option. Now the vopt option is only visible in product
       version that support it.
     * Hovering with the mouse on the Source window generate PLI errors.
     * The Wave window won't respond to keyboard commands.
     * Dataflow window memory requirements have been reduced and performance
       improved by optimization of dataflow query algorithms.
     * Dataflow window sometimes did not provide a complete view of a signal
       for mixed VHDL-Verilog designs.
     * During C Debug Init mode operation, RPC-blocked-1 messages were not
       caught when the simulate menu was activated.
     * There were two problems searching in the Wave and List windows for
       signal values of vectors. First, if the radix was set by the radix
       command, rather than directly clicking on the signal, the search failed
       to properly interpret the target value. Secondly, if the radix were set
       to decimal or unsigned, the initial target value was displayed in double
       quotes, which caused the evaluator to fail.
     * The "wlfman profile" report did not include the last object logged.
     * In certain cases the "wlfman filter" operation generated redundant
       events when optimized. This caused display errors at large zoom ranges
       when displaying a filtered WLF file.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1d
     * Short-circuit operators failed to short-circuit in some cases where an
       operand was a class member reference of a class object that was not
       allocated, resulting in a crash during simulation.
     * Timing check conditions on module input ports with SDF annotated delays
       could be incorrectly evaluated.
     * SystemVerilog  designs  with  DPI  export  tf's errored out during
       elaboration if a non-standard work library was used (i.e. the work
       library is not named "work").
     * Module instance parameters failed to propagate correctly in some cases
       where the module was instantiated underneath a generate scope and where
       the parameter type itself depended on another parameter.
     * Calling system functions from within tasks or functions defined in a
       SystemVerilog package caused the simulator to crash while loading the
       package.
     * The  simulator  crashed  if  a  design contained both VHDL foreign
       subprograms and SystemVerilog DPI import tf's.
     * A  Verilog  parameter  value  being overridden by a generic with a
       hexidecimal  integer value containing an "E" was treated as a real
       instead of an integer.
     * vsim crashed in some situations where $swrite was called before an
       assignment to a bit-select by a hierarchical reference.
     * SystemVerilog designs that had interdependent packages or dependencies
       on $unit compiled successfully but vsim issued an error similar to:
       #   **   Error:   (vsim-13)   Recompile   work.MultiPkg2   because
       work.MultiPkg2Pkg2 has changed.
     * vopt sometimes computed package dependencies incorrectly if you had
       mutiple interdependent packages or packages dependent on $unit. vopt
       issued an error similar to:
       #    **    Error:    (vopt-7)    Failed    to   open   data   file
       "work/_opt/work_test_sv_unit_fast.dt2" in read mode.
     * Verilog functions called to perform a bit-select with constant arguments
       (e.g., "data[fn(1)]") incorrectly reported an error if the function did
       not qualify as a constant function.
     * The +nowarn<number> option did not fully suppress certain messages.
     * vlog now allows whitespace between the macro name and the parenthesis
       when the macro is used.
     * A restart on a design containing $fmonitor crashed the simulator in
       certain cases.
     * In some SystemVerilog designs, bit-vector ports were mistakenly driven
       as 4-state values. This caused the simulator to crash.
     * Execution of a recursive task or function call was skipped in some
       unusual cases in an optimized design.
     * The simulator crashed when assert property was inlined.
     * System functions $fscanf() and $sscanf() now conform to the LRM more
       closely.
     * The keyword "unsigned" is not valid anywhere in the 2001 syntax. Now a
       warning is issued if it's encountered.
     * The exponent operator previously give incorrect result for more than
       32-bit wide bit-type variables.
     * When a SystemVerilog associative array with a string key was assigned to
       another associative array with a string key, the compiler erroneously
       claimed that the array keys did not match. This happened when the target
       variable was not in the same package as the source.
     * Interactions  between  generates and package types caused compiler
       assertions.
     * Instanciations of optimized gate-level cells under SystemVerilog with
       port connections to registers did not function correctly and caused a
       simulation crash in certain cases.
     * Indexed access to an empty queue declared within an interface caused a
       stacktrace. The access is now trapped, and error message "Null instance
       dereference" is issued.
     * Compiling  a  SystemVerilog source file that imports packages from
       different libraries sometimes failed to find some of the packages.
     * When optimizing designs containing a mix of Verilog and SystemVerilog
       files,  the  Verilog  source  file  was  sometimes  optimized as a
       SystemVerilog source file thus causing syntax errors when SystemVerilog
       keywords were used as regular identifiers.
     * The vlog compiler crashed when compiling multiple SystemVerilog source
       files containing declarations in $unit scope when the -mfcu (multi-file
       compilation unit) option was used in conjunction with a libmap that
       targeted different libraries for some design units.
     * Performing a non-blocking assignment with an "iff" clause (for example:
       "wdata <= @(posedge clk iff ready) 1'b1") caused the simulator to crash.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1d
     * acc_handle_condition  now  returns  NULL on an ifnone condition as
       specified in the LRM.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1d
     * In some cases, aliases dependent on generics caused a crash.
     * The VHDL compiler and simulator now correctly handles disconnection
       (assignment of NULL) to subprogram signal parameters.
          + vcom  produces  a syntax error if the declaration of a signal
            parameter includes the words BUS or REGISTER. This error can be
            overridden or suppressed by a command line option or a change to
            the modelsim.ini file.
          + The simulator checks during runtime that a disconnected signal is a
            BUS or a REGISTER and issues an error if it is not.
     * A driving NULL array signal was not ignored in some cases and caused the
       simulator to crash.
     * Use of the 'simple_name, 'path_name, or 'instance_name attribute caused
       memory corruption and a potential crash.
     * The misuse of the VHDL 1993 report keyword in VHDL 1987 outside an
       assert statement is now identified by the tool.
     * The compiler crashed with signal 11 when analyzing code containing a
       globally static slice range used in a concurrent signal assignment
       statement expression appearing immediately in an architecture statement
       part (or in a slice name appearing in a sensitivity list of a process
       statement) followed by an identical range used in the subtype indication
       of a constant declaration appearing in a subprogram declaration region.
     * Certain PSL expressions involving boolean types caused the compiler to
       crash in certain cases.
     * vcom crashed with a signal 11 during an array index computation.
     * vsim  crashed on 64-bit platforms when arrays of access types were
       compiled withot optimization (-O0 was specified).
     * The compiler generated bad code when a locally static error involving a
       string literal that had array index bounds that did not belong to the
       array index subtype was present in the statements in a GENERATE block.

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1d
     * When  the coverage off source code pragma was used, conditions and
       expressions were not properly ignored. They were processed as if code
       coverage were still on.
     * The  coverage  save command was not properly saving instances that
       contained  only other instances and no RTL code. This caused those
       instances to not be available in vcover.
     * The  -strip  option to coverage reload and vcover was not properly
       skipping data in some cases in which the data needed to be skipped.
     * The output from a coverage report command with the -zeros switch now
       includes the file name(s) and line numbers(s) of the code of interest.
     * vcover would fail if the -strip option skipped a region that contained a
       toggle signal of type enum or integer.
     * In some cases, generate instances with parameterized signal widths
       caused a fatal assertion in vsim when code coverage was on and the
       parameterized signals were included in toggle coverage. This has been
       changed to give a warning that the signals for some instances are not
       included in the design unit summary because the widths are different.
     * vcover report -bydu -xml incorrectly included HDL source text in the XML
       file that it generated.
     * The profile reload command caused a crash in some cases.

   Known Defects in 6.1d
     * This  is  a  reminder that code coverage does not do short circuit
       evaluation of if conditions. So if you turn on condition coverage and
       you get a crash, that is the first thing you should check.

   Product Changes to 6.1d
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1d
     * The  SDF  error  and  warning  messages  will now print additional
       information, such as module name, source file name and line number,
       about the targeted module, when +sdf_verbose has been specified on the
       vsim command line. In the vopt flow some of this new information may not
       be accurate due to information lost in the optimizations.
