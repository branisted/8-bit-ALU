<ul>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
	<ul>
	<li>win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
	<li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9, 10
	<li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
In some windows the Find dialog short cut did not work when the window is undocked.
</li>
<li>
The children of an expanded SystemVerilog unpacked array of 2-state elements did not display correctly in the Wave window.
</li>
<li>
WLF scanning with transactions could report false values for some non-transaction items.  This was visible in the Wave window or with 'examine -time ...', for example.  This would occur after the end of the scanned data or in places where logging was disabled for the item.  The value should have been reported as "No_Data".  In addition, this fix includes changes so that transaction stream and attribute values are "No_Data" after the end of the WLF data.
</li>
<li>
The compile status for project files was not showing. This issue is now fixed.</li>
<li>
The add_menu procedure failed when used in a scenario like this: "set w [toplevel .paper]; add_menu $w File". </li>
<li>
The trailing characters of long signal names were sometimes truncated in the Wave window.
</li>
<li>
Context-menu item "Save Files..." restored to "Files" pane... emits a sorted duplicate-free list of all the files used in the design (based on "write report").</li>
<li>
Long environment pathnames (i.e. contexts) shown in the GUI's footer area were difficult to see because they were left justified. This has been fixed to make sure the leaf portion of the path is always visible. The full path can be seen by hovering the mouse pointer over the footer, which displays the path in a tooltip.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The compiler crashed generating code for a bitwise infix expression having a hierarchical reference as one operand and a comparision operator that folds to a constant as the other operand.</li>
<li>
There were differences between the iopath selection for notifier generated X outputs from optimized gate-level cells when +delayed_timing_checks is in use.</li>
<li>
An out-of-bounds index into an array of vector nets resulted in a simulator elaboration crash rather than an error message.</li>
<li>
An event control on an indexed hierarchical reference within a task declared in a class resulted in the following false error from the compiler if the index referenced a class member variable:
<br>
<code>
** Error: testfile(5): Illegal assignment expression in event control.
</code>
</li>
<li>
SDF annotation crashed when used with +delayed_timing_checks.</li>
<li>
Using ## in a nested module where the default clocking block is declared in the parent module incorrectly reported error that the default clocking block was not found.</li>
<li>
vopt produced an internal error when optimizing a module containing a part select or bit select of a port where the port size did not match the port size of the parent module.</li>
<li>
Calls involving STDOUT and STDERR in $fflush might have resulted the error message:<br>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-PLI-3085) t.v(4): $fflush : Argument 1 is an unknown file
descriptor.
</code>

</li>
<li>
Calling process::kill() for an always block process failed to stop the always block from executing in some cases.</li>
<li>
When an automatic variable was only used as an array index inside a fork..join block in an automatic task or function, an incorrect array index was calculated in some cases.</li>
<li>
vopt no longer crashes when referencing a non-existant task imported from a virtual interface.
</li>
<li>
When $setuphold/$recrem timing checks occurring without explicit delay net specifications and +delayed_timing_checks is used, the delay net solution may not solve correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Some problems with the <b>-learn</b> option have been fixed. These include fixes for intermittent crashes with vpi_put_value()and signalspy learning under certain conditions; and a fix for an infinite loop for some VHDL escaped identifiers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
vopt would incorrectly not re-optimize a design unit if one of it's instances
changed. For this to happen the lower instance needed to be instantiated within a block, for generate, or if generate scope.
</li>
<li>
Alias to composite signal parameter could cause the simulator to crash when the parameter's subprogram is called.</li>
<li>
An elaboration time crash could occur when using block ports.  The block port must be a vector that is constrained by a generic on the block and the port must be initialized with a constant literal.</li>
<li>
If a configuration is used to bind an instantiation with a port map which uses signals declared in the generate declaration region sometimes a crash is observed. This has now been fixed.
</li>
<li>
If a constrained port declaration had different bounds than the actual connected to the port, the actual's array bounds would be incorrectly used by the GUI as the port's array bound.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
If vsim issued an error while elaborating a SystemVerilog bind statement with a VHDL target, restarting the simulation using the <b>restart</b> command would make vsim crash. This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
When SystemC control_foreign_signal/observe_foreign_signal was invoked with a non-existant HDL signal, the error message issued would not stop simulation, or produce non-zero code after elaboration. Even raising the severity level of the error message to fatal would not stop simulation. This has been fixed, and now this error message has been converted to a warning message. Raising the severity of this message to error/fatal will now make the simulation stop.</li>
<li>
Using net-type (wire <type>) of a multi-dimensional array at the SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary would sometimes result in an incorrect type-mismatch error in vsim. This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
vgencomp would not generate correct datatypes for ports of SystemC type double and float in the generated component declaration. This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
Type-compatibility checks for unions would be skipped at the SystemC-SystemVerilog mixed-language boundary when a SystemVerilog array of unions is connected element-by-element to a SystemC array of signals of type union. This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
When a SystemVerilog bind construct is used to bind output ports of the Verilog module to an input port of the VHDL target, vopt would issue an incorrect error message while vsim would simulate the design producing correct results with <b>-novopt</b>. This has been fixed, and now vopt does not generate the incorrect error message.
</li>
<li>
scgenmod would generate an internal error when invoked on SystemVerilog interfaces. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>
Binding to Verilog targets, using the SystemVerilog bind construct, would make vsim crash when vopt was invoked with the <b>+acc=p</b> option and the port-map contained a hierarchical reference as the actual expression. The same testcase would produce correct simulation results when vsim was invoked with <b>-novopt</b> command-line option. This has been fixed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>toggle add -exclude</b> command resulted in an irrelevant error message if the signal in question is not a vector.
The fix checks whether the signal passed to the command is a vector and shows a meaningful error message in case of a scalar signal passed.
</li>
<li>
Aggregate evaluation during FSM extraction would sometimes result in a crash in vopt. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>
Toggle with escaped names were not expandable in the Toggles tab in the Missed Coverage window.
</li>
<li>
The following checkbuttons are added in the Advanced Options dialog of the Coverage Text Report to turn off printing coverpoint and cross summary lines.
<UL>
<LI> No Coverpoint Summary
<LI> No Cross Summary
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Fixed Tcl error in transcript when a design is loaded in GUI without coverage from a loaded vsim with coverage where the Source window is displayed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
A crash would occur if the user attempted a second restart after the first restart failed during elaboration.</li>
<li>
Sometimes after a restart, zoom full in the Wave window would not work until the window was resized or otherwise refreshed.
</li>
<li>
The <b>vlib -format 1 &lt;library&gt;</b> command could not be used to convert a library format backwards for use with a pre-6.3d release. This has been fixed, provided that the library format is first converted and then "refreshed" with the <b>-refresh</b> option of the compiler using the current release, and then refreshed again with the older release.
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop at the breakpoint. </li>
<li>
On Windows platform, if breakpoint is set on a SystemC object destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which will prevent unloading of the shared library.</li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
vlog will now print an "unsupported" error message for nested design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3.  This error may be suppressed using the <b>-suppress 2230</b> command-line options.</li>
<li>
For viewing events in Expanded Time in the List window, use the "configure list" command with the "-delta events" option.  "events" is added to the "all", "collapse", and "none" options for the "-delta" argument.  These options control the details shown in the List window and in writing list files.  This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.

The "write list -events" command serves a different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control Expanded Time viewing in List window.

</li>
<li>
The "examine", "searchlog", and "seetime" commands have NOT been enhanced
for use with Expanded Time.  This was documented incorrectly in the
"Expanded Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of the
"Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
</li>
<li>
If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of warning:<br>
# Loading mypackage(body) <br>
# Internal Warning in process_sub: failed to find local inlined subprogram 
called in pkg<br>
#     (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2<br>
#     Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram<br>
Then add the <b>-noFunctionInline</b> option to <b>vcom</b> for that package, 
or reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they are used.</li>
<li>
Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules, 
interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.</li>
<li>
Using the profiler on Solaris 8 can result in the error, "Setitimer: Permission denied."  To prevent this error, set the environment variable MTI_THREAD_DISABLE to 1. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.4c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The priority of +initreg/+initmem options is adjusted from the previous versions.  Now, the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vopt with design unit or instance name have the highest priority.  After that, these options applied to vlog have the next priority and the vopt +initreg/+initmem options have the last priority.  In earlier versions, the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vlog command had higher priority than design unit or instance specific +initreg/+initmem vopt options.</li>
<li>
To improve usability, the Run toolbar has been changed: a Break button has been added.
</li>
<li>
The text-based windows (Transcript, Notepad and Source) now have an "inline" search bar (instead of a dialog box) which supports incremental searching. The previous behavior can be restored using the "Main/InlineTextSearch" option.</li>
<li>
Several fatal elaboration errors will now print the line # where the error occurred.</li>
<li>
The new enhanced support of analog format within the Wave window includes a change to the output created by "write format wave". In pre-6.4 the output for the "add wave" commands would include "-offset" and "-scale". Starting in 6.4 the output will instead use "-min" and "-max".</li>
<li>
When vpi_iterate and vpi_scan are used on an array of instances, the individual elements will now be returned left-to-right, where they formerly were returned low-to-high.  For example if they are applied to "mymodule u1[2:0]();", the elements returned will be u1[2], u1[1], u1[0].</li>
<li>
Each tag in a taglist (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
VCD extensions for SystemVerilog supported as per Section 24: VCD Data in IEEE-P1800.  LRM is not extending VCD for interfaces and programs. They will be dumped as "module" scope.</li>
<li>
The source window has been changed to remove the separate column used to display breakpoints. Breakpoints will be shown within the "line number" column (as they were in the pre-6.3 releases). The LMB event handling has been improved to avoid inadvertant setting of breakpoints. Also, there is now a subtle visual separator bar between the text area and the line number column to help guide the user during text selection.</li>
<li>
The coverage numbers shown in the source window can appear to be in conflict with what's shown in the "Missed Coverage" window. This occurs when the Missed Coverage window is in "By Instance" mode and the source window is in "By File" mode. The latter is the default for the source window but it gives no indication what its current mode is. To make it clear for the user, the title bar of the source window will be enhanced to include the current coverage data mode(either "by file" or "by instance").</li>
<li>
The Contains toolbar now supports multiple wildcard modes.  The default mode is now "glob" style which is the more common form of wildcards as found in UNIX shells.  The wildcards are *, ?, [chars], and \x where x is any character, removing that character's special meaning.  

<p>Previously, this filtering tool used full regular expressions.  This option is selectable from the menu button in the Contains entry box, by selecting the value "regular-expression".</p>

<p>The third option, "exact", does not use wildcards so no characters have any special meaning.</p>

<p>In all modes, the search patterns are considered case insensitive.  If a case sensitive pattern is needed, use the regular-expression mode and perpend the search string with "(?c)".</p>

<p>The preference variable PrefMain(ContainsMode) defines the filter mode for all windows with one of the values of "glob", "regexp", or "exact".</p>

<p>More information on regular expressions can be found in the Tcl reference manual under "re_syntax".  Information on glob style matching can be found in the Tcl reference manual under the "string match" command.</p></li>
<li>
Macro arguments to Verilog and SystemVerilog macros are now expanded prior to substitution into the macro body.
 </li>
<li>
SDF annotation of RECREM or SETUPHOLD matching only a single setup/hold/recovery/removal timing check will result in a warning message.</li>
<li>
The transaction recording engine no longer issues a warning if a design attempts to record a transaction of zero length.</li>
<li>
The log and nolog commands are now supported for transaction streams of all kinds.  TR streams created through the SCV or Verilog APIs have logging enabled by default.  The rule is that a transaction will be logged in WLF if logging is enabled at the simulation time when the design calls ::begin_transaction() or $begin_transaction.  The effective start time of the transaction (the time passed by the design as a parameter to beginning the transaction) does not matter.  Thus, a stream could have logging disabled between T1 and T2 and still record a transaction in that period using retroactive logging after time T2.  A transaction is always entirely logged or entirely ignored.</li>
<li>
PSL LTL and OBE operators are now disabled by default.  Use -pslext vcom/vlog/vopt switch to enable these operators.</li>
<li>
The Win32/Win32PE platform executables (excluding vish.exe) are now linked with the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch. This switch allows an executable to allocate an extra gigabyte of process space (up to 3GB). The additional gigabyte of process space is available on Windows configurations that include the /3GB (/userva on Vista) boot switch.  Vish.exe is not linked with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE and we do not recommended that this switch be used with vish.exe.  Testing vish.exe with this switch exhibited a tendency to exceed the one GB system limitation which results in a crash.  When the simulator's GUI displays several windows with large amounts of graphical data and a full redraw occurs, a temporary surge in the allocation of system memory can cause the limit to be exceeded.

<li>
The behavior of virtual expressions has changed in a subtle way.  Normally when a virtual expression contains a relative context pathname, for example u1/x2/b, the current context would be used in order to resolve the name.  However, relative paths that started with a toplevel name would also be recognized, ignoring the current context.  This unintended behavior has been corrected so that the current context is always used to resolve a relative name.  This may cause some previously accepted virtual expressions to fail to be accepted.</li>
<li>
modules found through source library search are no longer treated by default as if they contained a `celldefine compiler directive. To obtain the old behavior, add +libcell to the vlog command line. Source library search is enabled with -v and -y compilation options.
Whether a module is considered a cell or not affects logging defaults with log -r *, coverage defaults within the module, and PLI access routines acc_next_cell and acc_next_cell_load. This change simplifies migration from other simulator products. </li>
<li>
Support for Verilog hierarchical references through VHDL design units has been
greatly improved. It is now possible for hierarchical references from a 
higher level Verilog to refer to objects in a Verilog module instantiated beneath a VHDL design unit.  In previous releases, upward references from a lower level Verilog module would only work if the target's scope was a direct parent, or a silbing that was instantiate lexially earlier in source. This restrictions are now removed. Hierarchical references that pass through a VHDL design will not work in the follow cases:
<ul>
<li> Is the target of a defparam.
<li> Used as an actual to a unconstrained VHDL port.
<li> Target of the reference is a VHDL object.
</ul></li>
<li>
A new toolbar has been added to the Wave window for access to the existing Bookmark functionality.</li>
<li>
Enabled use of the "contains" filter for the Files tab of the Workspace window.</li>
<li>
Support for some additional VPI features has been added in this release. The vpiDriver transition has been extended, and partial support for vpiContAssign objects has been added.</li>
<li>
When encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the encrypted Verilog file.
</li>
<li>
Wave searches initiated from the keyboard or toolbar buttons can now be stopped by clicking the Wave window's "Stop Wave Drawing" toolbar button or the Simulation toolbar's "Break" button.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog array manipulation methods now reflect the latest changes in the P1800 Draft5 version of the LRM, in that iteration occurs only in the top dimension of the array.  That is, the correct way to sum the elements of a 2-dimensional memory, as indicated in the LRM's example, is:
<p>
<br>logic [7:0] m [2][2] = '{ '{5, 10}, '{15, 20} };
<br>int y;
<br>y = m.sum with (item.sum with (item)); // y becomes 50 => 5+10+15+20
<p>
<br>Previously, ModelSim iterated through all the unpacked dimensions, "[2][2]" in this case.
</li>
<li>
When using C-debugger to debug quit callback functions, user needed to turn on 'stop on quit' mode. User start debugging by issuing 'quit -f' command. When simulation ends, user needed to quit C-debugger using 'cdbg quit' and then GUI using 'quit -f'. Now, Users do not need to issue extra commands at the end of the run. Simulator automatically quits C-debugger and GUI, after debugging is done and simulation has stopped running.</li>
<li>
If a VHDL signal is read during elaboration the value read may differ from value read in previous releases.  The VHDL LRM considers this illegal(Section 12.3) but tool behavior has always been to just warn and allow a value to be read. What the value read has always been undefined. Additionally previous releases allowed
functions and procedure with signal parameter to be called during elaboration. This is now illegal and reported at compile time.</li>
<li>
The menus which control the functional coverage tab display options (assertion, cover directives and functional coverage) have changed slightly.  Most significant of the changes is that each pane now has a separate control for "Show All Contexts" and "Recursive Mode" that is not shared with the other panes.  They are available with the right mouse click popup window as well as under the tool's main menu, under the "Display Options" menu pick.</li>
<li>
The <b>bp</b> command now outputs a list of existing C breakpoints with their enabled/disabled states in the <b>bp</b> command syntax, so that this output can be saved and executed later to recreate the breakpoints. 
</li>
<li>
The effect of assertions on some coverage features has changed.  Because asserion pass counts were not reliable without -assertdebug used in simulation, pass counts have been removed from the coverage database and reports by default.  (With -assertdebug, they remain, along with other counts.)  Also, the contribution of assertions to total coverage -- in the Verification Management Tracker and Browser -- has changed.  Previously, an assertion contributed to "100% coverage" if it non-vacuously passed at least once.  Now, with -assertdebug, "100% coverage" is met if an assertion both non-vacuously passed and never failed.  Without -assertdebug, "100% coverage" is met if the assertion never failed.  There is a new VM Browser column called "%SuccessAsserts" to indicate this statistic.  If assertions are included in a test plan, this statistic is automatically used in the VM Tracker and "coverage analyze" command.

Errors involving unpacked array assignment, where the packed elements do not match exactly (signed/unsigned, different widths, 2-state/4-state), may now be suppressed using '-suppress 7034'. </li>
<li>
The HTML report now shows the total number of covergroup bins per coverpoint or cross and, of those, how many were covered. This information appears on the covergroup details pages for each scope.</li>
<li>
When the simulation encounters an error during a run, a message will be displayed showing the file and line location of the error and the sequence of calls showing how it got there.  This is an extension of the Stopped At message displayed previously.  In GUI mode, this message may be used to view the file by double-clicking on the file name in the message.  This message may be suppressed by setting the PrefMain(noRunMsg) preference to 1.</li>
<li>
The assertion gui panel now will save the state of the display option settings when the simulation exits.</li>
<li>
The vsim -title switch can now be used with the -load_elab switch.  Previously this option was disallowed.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A new argument <b>-item</b> has been added to the <b>coverage exclude</b> command. This is to allow exclusions to be finer grained than by line. Now, if a source line contains more than one coverage item, the user can selectively apply exclusions for a subset of them. Coverage types affected by this change are statements, branches, expressions, and conditions. Items are numbered in left-to-right order within a line -- regardless of nesting -- from 1 upward. Item numbering is per type. So, if a source line contains two statements and two branches, the first of each type will get an item number of 1. The syntax for the new <b>–item</b> argument is as follows:<br>
<code>-item [bces]* [int | int-int]+</code>
<br>
A limitation on the use of <b>–item</b> is that a single invocation can have at most one <b>–item</b> argument. The <b>–item</b> argument can be mixed with other arguments of coverage exclude command.
