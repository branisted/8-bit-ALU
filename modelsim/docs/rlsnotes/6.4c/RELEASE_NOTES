   Key Information
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9, 10
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * In some windows the Find dialog short cut did not work when the window
       is undocked.
     * The children of an expanded SystemVerilog unpacked array of 2-state
       elements did not display correctly in the Wave window.
     * WLF  scanning with transactions could report false values for some
       non-transaction items. This was visible in the Wave window or with
       'examine -time ...', for example. This would occur after the end of the
       scanned data or in places where logging was disabled for the item. The
       value should have been reported as "No_Data". In addition, this fix
       includes changes so that transaction stream and attribute values are
       "No_Data" after the end of the WLF data.
     * The compile status for project files was not showing. This issue is now
       fixed.
     * The add_menu procedure failed when used in a scenario like this: "set w
       [toplevel .paper]; add_menu $w File".
     * The trailing characters of long signal names were sometimes truncated in
       the Wave window.
     * Context-menu item "Save Files..." restored to "Files" pane... emits a
       sorted duplicate-free list of all the files used in the design (based on
       "write report").
     * Long environment pathnames (i.e. contexts) shown in the GUI's footer
       area were difficult to see because they were left justified. This has
       been fixed to make sure the leaf portion of the path is always visible.
       The full path can be seen by hovering the mouse pointer over the footer,
       which displays the path in a tooltip.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * The compiler crashed generating code for a bitwise infix expression
       having  a  hierarchical reference as one operand and a comparision
       operator that folds to a constant as the other operand.
     * There  were  differences between the iopath selection for notifier
       generated   X   outputs   from  optimized  gate-level  cells  when
       +delayed_timing_checks is in use.
     * An  out-of-bounds index into an array of vector nets resulted in a
       simulator elaboration crash rather than an error message.
     * An event control on an indexed hierarchical reference within a task
       declared in a class resulted in the following false error from the
       compiler if the index referenced a class member variable:
       ** Error: testfile(5): Illegal assignment expression in event control.
     * SDF annotation crashed when used with +delayed_timing_checks.
     * Using ## in a nested module where the default clocking block is declared
       in  the  parent module incorrectly reported error that the default
       clocking block was not found.
     * vopt produced an internal error when optimizing a module containing a
       part select or bit select of a port where the port size did not match
       the port size of the parent module.
     * Calls involving STDOUT and STDERR in $fflush might have resulted the
       error message:
       # ** Error: (vsim-PLI-3085) t.v(4): $fflush : Argument 1 is an unknown
       file descriptor.
     * Calling process::kill() for an always block process failed to stop the
       always block from executing in some cases.
     * When an automatic variable was only used as an array index inside a
       fork..join block in an automatic task or function, an incorrect array
       index was calculated in some cases.
     * vopt no longer crashes when referencing a non-existant task imported
       from a virtual interface.
     * When $setuphold/$recrem timing checks occurring without explicit delay
       net specifications and +delayed_timing_checks is used, the delay net
       solution may not solve correctly.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * Some problems with the -learn option have been fixed. These include
       fixes  for  intermittent crashes with vpi_put_value()and signalspy
       learning under certain conditions; and a fix for an infinite loop for
       some VHDL escaped identifiers.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * vopt would incorrectly not re-optimize a design unit if one of it's
       instances changed. For this to happen the lower instance needed to be
       instantiated within a block, for generate, or if generate scope.
     * Alias to composite signal parameter could cause the simulator to crash
       when the parameter's subprogram is called.
     * An elaboration time crash could occur when using block ports. The block
       port must be a vector that is constrained by a generic on the block and
       the port must be initialized with a constant literal.
     * If a configuration is used to bind an instantiation with a port map
       which uses signals declared in the generate declaration region sometimes
       a crash is observed. This has now been fixed.
     * If a constrained port declaration had different bounds than the actual
       connected to the port, the actual's array bounds would be incorrectly
       used by the GUI as the port's array bound.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.4c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.4c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * A sc_fifo of a class containing only a sc_uint would lead to a crash if
       N is not a power of 2. This is fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.4c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * If vsim issued an error while elaborating a SystemVerilog bind statement
       with a VHDL target, restarting the simulation using the restart command
       would make vsim crash. This has been fixed.
     * When SystemC control_foreign_signal/observe_foreign_signal was invoked
       with a non-existant HDL signal, the error message issued would not stop
       simulation, or produce non-zero code after elaboration. Even raising the
       severity level of the error message to fatal would not stop simulation.
       This has been fixed, and now this error message has been converted to a
       warning message. Raising the severity of this message to error/fatal
       will now make the simulation stop.
     * Using  net-type  (wire  )  of  a  multi-dimensional  array  at the
       SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary would sometimes result in an
       incorrect type-mismatch error in vsim. This has been fixed.
     * vgencomp would not generate correct datatypes for ports of SystemC type
       double and float in the generated component declaration. This has been
       fixed.
     * Type-compatibility  checks  for  unions  would  be  skipped at the
       SystemC-SystemVerilog mixed-language boundary when a SystemVerilog array
       of unions is connected element-by-element to a SystemC array of signals
       of type union. This has been fixed.
     * When a SystemVerilog bind construct is used to bind output ports of the
       Verilog module to an input port of the VHDL target, vopt would issue an
       incorrect error message while vsim would simulate the design producing
       correct results with -novopt. This has been fixed, and now vopt does not
       generate the incorrect error message.
     * scgenmod would generate an internal error when invoked on SystemVerilog
       interfaces. This has been fixed.
     * Binding to Verilog targets, using the SystemVerilog bind construct,
       would make vsim crash when vopt was invoked with the +acc=p option and
       the  port-map  contained  a  hierarchical  reference as the actual
       expression. The same testcase would produce correct simulation results
       when vsim was invoked with -novopt command-line option. This has been
       fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * The toggle add -exclude command resulted in an irrelevant error message
       if the signal in question is not a vector. The fix checks whether the
       signal passed to the command is a vector and shows a meaningful error
       message in case of a scalar signal passed.
     * Aggregate evaluation during FSM extraction would sometimes result in a
       crash in vopt. This has now been fixed.
     * Toggle with escaped names were not expandable in the Toggles tab in the
       Missed Coverage window.
     * The following checkbuttons are added in the Advanced Options dialog of
       the Coverage Text Report to turn off printing coverpoint and cross
       summary lines.
          + No Coverpoint Summary
          + No Cross Summary
     * Fixed Tcl error in transcript when a design is loaded in GUI without
       coverage from a loaded vsim with coverage where the Source window is
       displayed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.4c
     * A crash would occur if the user attempted a second restart after the
       first restart failed during elaboration.
     * Sometimes after a restart, zoom full in the Wave window would not work
       until the window was resized or otherwise refreshed.
     * The vlib -format 1 <library> command could not be used to convert a
       library format backwards for use with a pre-6.3d release. This has been
       fixed, provided that the library format is first converted and then
       "refreshed" with the -refresh option of the compiler using the current
       release, and then refreshed again with the older release.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.4c
     * dts0100378184 - Problems with ctrl-f "Find".
     * dts0100493545 - Assertion options need disabling in viewcov mode.
     * dts0100514333 - Zoom full button (for wave pane or window) does not work
       after a reload.
     * dts0100523934 - The specified object could not be found in the design,
       message does not trigger error/fatal.
     * dts0100526454 - Crash using incremental compile and restart in vopt
       mode.
     * dts0100526570 - Issue with null dereference with 6.4.
     * dts0100528917 - 'vlib -format' operation doesn't appear to function.
     * dts0100536014 - VHDL generate/procedure/alias results in a segfault.
     * dts0100536814 - Vsim error depending on the order of declaration of an
       interface.
     * dts0100541639 - When using projects: Under "Status" field in "Projects"
       tab, cannot see the regular status icons (X or ? or tick).
     * dts0100543247  -  vopt  crash  in  aggregate evaluation during FSM
       extraction.
     * dts0100543528 - Truncated signal paths in the Wave window.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.4c
     * On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set
       via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop
       at the breakpoint.
     * On  Windows  platform,  if  breakpoint  is set on a SystemC object
       destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This
       crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which
       will prevent unloading of the shared library.
     * The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in
       behavior compared to the vsim mode version. In the viewcov mode version,
       clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the
       coverage data for that design unit, itself. Also, if you clear coverage
       data  in  a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not
       affected by that operation. In vsim mode, the data is more tightly
       linked such that one operation affects the other. In viewcov mode, if
       you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design
       units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
       on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an add
       wave command, when the working directory was created under an older
       32-bit Linux OS.
       This  is  a  Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
       simulator.
       A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator with
       command line option -wlfnolock.
     * The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable. The unwinder is
       the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program
       execution is at. The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance
       data. This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance
       data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.
     * Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and
       memory  profiling at the same time. Memory profiling requires much
       overhead  process,  and it can skew the results of the performance
       profiling data.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on
       consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.
     * On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs
       during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal,
       and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting
       with proper error status.
     * vlog  will  now  print  an  "unsupported" error message for nested
       design-units, as this feature is not fully supported in 6.3. This error
       may be suppressed using the -suppress 2230 command-line options.
     * For  viewing  events  in Expanded Time in the List window, use the
       "configure list" command with the "-delta events" option. "events" is
       added to the "all", "collapse", and "none" options for the "-delta"
       argument. These options control the details shown in the List window and
       in writing list files. This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded
       Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis"
       chapter of the User's Manual. The "write list -events" command serves a
       different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control
       Expanded Time viewing in List window.
     * The  "examine",  "searchlog", and "seetime" commands have NOT been
       enhanced for use with Expanded Time. This was documented incorrectly in
       the "Expanded Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of
       the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
     * If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of
       warning:
       # Loading mypackage(body)
       #  Internal  Warning  in process_sub: failed to find local inlined
       subprogram called in pkg
       # (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2
       # Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram
       Then add the -noFunctionInline option to vcom for that package, or
       reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they
       are used.
     * Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules,
       interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
       module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
       code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
       instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.
     * Using the profiler on Solaris 8 can result in the error, "Setitimer:
       Permission denied." To prevent this error, set the environment variable
       MTI_THREAD_DISABLE to 1.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.4c
     * The priority of +initreg/+initmem options is adjusted from the previous
       versions. Now, the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vopt with
       design unit or instance name have the highest priority. After that,
       these  options applied to vlog have the next priority and the vopt
       +initreg/+initmem options have the last priority. In earlier versions,
       the +initreg/+initmem options specified to vlog command had higher
       priority than design unit or instance specific +initreg/+initmem vopt
       options.
     * To improve usability, the Run toolbar has been changed: a Break button
       has been added.
     * The text-based windows (Transcript, Notepad and Source) now have an
       "inline" search bar (instead of a dialog box) which supports incremental
       searching.  The  previous  behavior  can  be  restored  using  the
       "Main/InlineTextSearch" option.
     * Several fatal elaboration errors will now print the line # where the
       error occurred.
     * The  new  enhanced support of analog format within the Wave window
       includes a change to the output created by "write format wave". In
       pre-6.4 the output for the "add wave" commands would include "-offset"
       and "-scale". Starting in 6.4 the output will instead use "-min" and
       "-max".
     * When vpi_iterate and vpi_scan are used on an array of instances, the
       individual elements will now be returned left-to-right, where they
       formerly were returned low-to-high. For example if they are applied to
       "mymodule u1[2:0]();", the elements returned will be u1[2], u1[1],
       u1[0].
     * Each tag in a taglist (used as data extraction parameters) may now
       include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by
       tag  name  but also by the contents of attributes attached to said
       elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can
       only  examine  the  attribute values attached to the element being
       compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.
       For example, the following extraction parameter:
"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"
       will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet>
       but will not match the following element:
<Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet>
     * The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility
       has  been  clarified  to  allow  various  parameters  to work more
       independently.  The  affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags,
       excludetags, and startstoring.
     * VCD extensions for SystemVerilog supported as per Section 24: VCD Data
       in IEEE-P1800. LRM is not extending VCD for interfaces and programs.
       They will be dumped as "module" scope.
     * The source window has been changed to remove the separate column used to
       display breakpoints. Breakpoints will be shown within the "line number"
       column (as they were in the pre-6.3 releases). The LMB event handling
       has been improved to avoid inadvertant setting of breakpoints. Also,
       there is now a subtle visual separator bar between the text area and the
       line number column to help guide the user during text selection.
     * The coverage numbers shown in the source window can appear to be in
       conflict with what's shown in the "Missed Coverage" window. This occurs
       when the Missed Coverage window is in "By Instance" mode and the source
       window is in "By File" mode. The latter is the default for the source
       window but it gives no indication what its current mode is. To make it
       clear for the user, the title bar of the source window will be enhanced
       to  include the current coverage data mode(either "by file" or "by
       instance").
     * The Contains toolbar now supports multiple wildcard modes. The default
       mode is now "glob" style which is the more common form of wildcards as
       found in UNIX shells. The wildcards are *, ?, [chars], and \x where x is
       any character, removing that character's special meaning.
       Previously, this filtering tool used full regular expressions. This
       option is selectable from the menu button in the Contains entry box, by
       selecting the value "regular-expression".
       The third option, "exact", does not use wildcards so no characters have
       any special meaning.
       In all modes, the search patterns are considered case insensitive. If a
       case sensitive pattern is needed, use the regular-expression mode and
       perpend the search string with "(?c)".
       The preference variable PrefMain(ContainsMode) defines the filter mode
       for all windows with one of the values of "glob", "regexp", or "exact".
       More  information  on  regular expressions can be found in the Tcl
       reference manual under "re_syntax". Information on glob style matching
       can  be found in the Tcl reference manual under the "string match"
       command.
     * Macro arguments to Verilog and SystemVerilog macros are now expanded
       prior to substitution into the macro body.
     * SDF  annotation  of  RECREM  or  SETUPHOLD  matching only a single
       setup/hold/recovery/removal  timing check will result in a warning
       message.
     * The transaction recording engine no longer issues a warning if a design
       attempts to record a transaction of zero length.
     * The log and nolog commands are now supported for transaction streams of
       all kinds. TR streams created through the SCV or Verilog APIs have
       logging enabled by default. The rule is that a transaction will be
       logged in WLF if logging is enabled at the simulation time when the
       design calls ::begin_transaction() or $begin_transaction. The effective
       start  time of the transaction (the time passed by the design as a
       parameter to beginning the transaction) does not matter. Thus, a stream
       could  have  logging disabled between T1 and T2 and still record a
       transaction in that period using retroactive logging after time T2. A
       transaction is always entirely logged or entirely ignored.
     * PSL LTL and OBE operators are now disabled by default. Use -pslext
       vcom/vlog/vopt switch to enable these operators.
     * The Win32/Win32PE platform executables (excluding vish.exe) are now
       linked  with  the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch. This switch allows an
       executable to allocate an extra gigabyte of process space (up to 3GB).
       The  additional  gigabyte of process space is available on Windows
       configurations that include the /3GB (/userva on Vista) boot switch.
       Vish.exe is not linked with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE and we do not recommended
       that this switch be used with vish.exe. Testing vish.exe with this
       switch exhibited a tendency to exceed the one GB system limitation which
       results in a crash. When the simulator's GUI displays several windows
       with  large  amounts of graphical data and a full redraw occurs, a
       temporary surge in the allocation of system memory can cause the limit
       to be exceeded.
     * The  behavior  of virtual expressions has changed in a subtle way.
       Normally when a virtual expression contains a relative context pathname,
       for example u1/x2/b, the current context would be used in order to
       resolve the name. However, relative paths that started with a toplevel
       name  would also be recognized, ignoring the current context. This
       unintended behavior has been corrected so that the current context is
       always used to resolve a relative name. This may cause some previously
       accepted virtual expressions to fail to be accepted.
     * modules found through source library search are no longer treated by
       default as if they contained a `celldefine compiler directive. To obtain
       the old behavior, add +libcell to the vlog command line. Source library
       search is enabled with -v and -y compilation options. Whether a module
       is considered a cell or not affects logging defaults with log -r *,
       coverage  defaults  within  the  module,  and  PLI access routines
       acc_next_cell and acc_next_cell_load. This change simplifies migration
       from other simulator products.
     * Support for Verilog hierarchical references through VHDL design units
       has  been  greatly  improved.  It is now possible for hierarchical
       references from a higher level Verilog to refer to objects in a Verilog
       module instantiated beneath a VHDL design unit. In previous releases,
       upward references from a lower level Verilog module would only work if
       the  target's  scope  was  a  direct parent, or a silbing that was
       instantiate  lexially earlier in source. This restrictions are now
       removed. Hierarchical references that pass through a VHDL design will
       not work in the follow cases:
          + Is the target of a defparam.
          + Used as an actual to a unconstrained VHDL port.
          + Target of the reference is a VHDL object.
     * A  new toolbar has been added to the Wave window for access to the
       existing Bookmark functionality.
     * Enabled use of the "contains" filter for the Files tab of the Workspace
       window.
     * Support for some additional VPI features has been added in this release.
       The vpiDriver transition has been extended, and partial support for
       vpiContAssign objects has been added.
     * When  encrypting Verilog source text any macros without parameters
       defined on the command line are substituted (not expanded) into the
       encrypted Verilog file.
     * Wave searches initiated from the keyboard or toolbar buttons can now be
       stopped by clicking the Wave window's "Stop Wave Drawing" toolbar button
       or the Simulation toolbar's "Break" button.
     * The SystemVerilog array manipulation methods now reflect the latest
       changes in the P1800 Draft5 version of the LRM, in that iteration occurs
       only in the top dimension of the array. That is, the correct way to sum
       the  elements of a 2-dimensional memory, as indicated in the LRM's
       example, is:
       logic [7:0] m [2][2] = '{ '{5, 10}, '{15, 20} };
       int y;
       y = m.sum with (item.sum with (item)); // y becomes 50 => 5+10+15+20
       Previously, ModelSim iterated through all the unpacked dimensions,
       "[2][2]" in this case.
     * When using C-debugger to debug quit callback functions, user needed to
       turn on 'stop on quit' mode. User start debugging by issuing 'quit -f'
       command. When simulation ends, user needed to quit C-debugger using
       'cdbg quit' and then GUI using 'quit -f'. Now, Users do not need to
       issue extra commands at the end of the run. Simulator automatically
       quits C-debugger and GUI, after debugging is done and simulation has
       stopped running.
     * If a VHDL signal is read during elaboration the value read may differ
       from  value read in previous releases. The VHDL LRM considers this
       illegal(Section 12.3) but tool behavior has always been to just warn and
       allow a value to be read. What the value read has always been undefined.
       Additionally previous releases allowed functions and procedure with
       signal parameter to be called during elaboration. This is now illegal
       and reported at compile time.
     * The menus which control the functional coverage tab display options
       (assertion, cover directives and functional coverage) have changed
       slightly. Most significant of the changes is that each pane now has a
       separate control for "Show All Contexts" and "Recursive Mode" that is
       not shared with the other panes. They are available with the right mouse
       click popup window as well as under the tool's main menu, under the
       "Display Options" menu pick.
     * The bp command now outputs a list of existing C breakpoints with their
       enabled/disabled states in the bp command syntax, so that this output
       can be saved and executed later to recreate the breakpoints.
     * The effect of assertions on some coverage features has changed. Because
       asserion pass counts were not reliable without -assertdebug used in
       simulation, pass counts have been removed from the coverage database and
       reports by default. (With -assertdebug, they remain, along with other
       counts.) Also, the contribution of assertions to total coverage -- in
       the  Verification  Management  Tracker and Browser -- has changed.
       Previously,  an  assertion  contributed  to  "100% coverage" if it
       non-vacuously  passed at least once. Now, with -assertdebug, "100%
       coverage" is met if an assertion both non-vacuously passed and never
       failed. Without -assertdebug, "100% coverage" is met if the assertion
       never failed. There is a new VM Browser column called "%SuccessAsserts"
       to indicate this statistic. If assertions are included in a test plan,
       this statistic is automatically used in the VM Tracker and "coverage
       analyze" command.
     * Following modifications have been done to coverage switches:

            Earlier name             New name
       -coverNoSub            -nocoversub
       -nocoverNoSub          -coversub
       -coverExcludeDefault   -coverexcludedefault
       -nocoverExcludeDefault -nocoverexcludedefault
       -fsmnoresettrans       -nofsmresttrans
     * Errors involving unpacked array assignment, where the packed elements do
       not match exactly (signed/unsigned, different widths, 2-state/4-state),
       may now be suppressed using '-suppress 7034'.
     * The  HTML report now shows the total number of covergroup bins per
       coverpoint  or  cross  and,  of those, how many were covered. This
       information appears on the covergroup details pages for each scope.
     * When the simulation encounters an error during a run, a message will be
       displayed  showing the file and line location of the error and the
       sequence of calls showing how it got there. This is an extension of the
       Stopped At message displayed previously. In GUI mode, this message may
       be used to view the file by double-clicking on the file name in the
       message.   This   message   may   be  suppressed  by  setting  the
       PrefMain(noRunMsg) preference to 1.
     * The assertion gui panel now will save the state of the display option
       settings when the simulation exits.
     * The vsim -title switch can now be used with the -load_elab switch.
       Previously this option was disallowed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.4c
     * A new argument -item has been added to the coverage exclude command.
       This is to allow exclusions to be finer grained than by line. Now, if a
       source  line  contains  more  than one coverage item, the user can
       selectively  apply exclusions for a subset of them. Coverage types
       affected by this change are statements, branches, expressions, and
       conditions. Items are numbered in left-to-right order within a line --
       regardless of nesting -- from 1 upward. Item numbering is per type. So,
       if a source line contains two statements and two branches, the first of
       each type will get an item number of 1. The syntax for the new item
       argument is as follows:
       -item [bces]* [int | int-int]+
       A limitation on the use of item is that a single invocation can have at
       most  one item argument. The item argument can be mixed with other
       arguments of coverage exclude command.
