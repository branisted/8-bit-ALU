<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Wave format Analog Custom dialog comes out empty.</li>
<li>
C/C++ source files containing both the // and /**/ comment delimiters can cause the Source window to hang. An example would be //*****//.</li>
<li>
When a divider was added to the Wave window via the "new divider" dialog box, an error would occur when attempting to copy or cut and then paste the divider.</li>
<li>
Selection in the Coverage Instance window is lost after certain commands or operations are executed, causing the user to have to re-navigate to the desired location.</li>
<li>
vopt would run during a <b>restart</b> command if vopt options were specified with double quotes when running the vsim command using <b>-voptargs</b> from inside the user interface. For example, <b>-voptargs="+acc"</b>.</li>
<li>
Some signals in WLF files were loosing transitions when viewed optimized and scaled out (i.e. view all).  The display is correct if viewed with <b>-wlfnooptimize</b>.  The incorrect WLF files can be corrected using wlfman from the fixed version, with the 'filter' option.  </li>
<li>
Slices of an array in an interface cannot be displayed in Wave window.</li>
<li>
Source annotation did not work when source files were compiled together on one command line in certain cases.</li>
<li>
Source annotation was not displayed for some optimized designs.</li>
<li>
Double-clicking on a signal name in the Source window produced a TCL error.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Wave Search Signal (search for signal value) in Wave window was not working if the signal is declared as an integer and vsim uses radix unsigned.  The signal value over 9 (more than one digit) will not be found. 
<li>Frequency value printed in Wave window was incorrect if vsim has the resolution with 10 or 100(ps, ns, fs).  It was working fine if the resolution is 1 (ps, ns, fs).
</ul></li>
<li>
The <b>tb</b> command sometimes reported the wrong subprogram name in VHDL designs.</li>
<li>
Various windows will not return to the previous user specified sort order when restarted or re-invoked.</li>
<li>
If a Source window is expanded in the MDI to fit the complete GUI window 
and there are multiple source tabs within the MDI, or any other tabs, i.e, Wave, Dataflow etc, then when the window is closed via the "x" button, the remaining MDI windows are unexpanded and returned to normal mode. The expectation is that the window would stay in the expanded view and one of the other tabs selected.  This has been fixed to behave as expected. Only when the last MDI window is closed will the U/I return to the normal view mode.</li>
<li>
User configurable grid spacing does not work when the time line is in simulation time mode.  This has been fixed by adding an optional "Auto Period" option.  When this option is enabled, the grid period will be determined by the major tick marks in the time line.  When this option is unchecked, the user specified grid period will be used.</li>
<li>
Verification Management has redesigned dialogs for "Configure Column Layout"(browser and tracker), setup for "Command Execution"(browser), and setup for "Filter"(tracker).  All of them provide naming ability to save different setups.</li>
<li>
Testbrowser pane is providing short keys 'Delete' for "Remove File" -> "From Browser Only" and 'Control-Delete' for "Remove File" -> "Browser and File System".</li>
<li>
Tcl cannot "source" or "do" files that are accessed through paths that contain a soft link and "..".</li>
<li>
Grouping transactions in Wave window could lead to unexpected behavior in earlier versions.  This has now been fixed so that transactions may be members of wave-window groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The error messaging system has been improved when the compiler detects an unexpected end of Verilog source text.</li>
<li>
A process, edge sensitive to a vector, could fail to execute when a different process is sensitive to a single bit of the vector.</li>
<li>
On the Windows platform, an error occurred when optimizing named or unnamed user defined primitives that were loaded from an unmapped library. An error messages of the following form was generated in this case.<br>
<code>
** Error: file.v(1000): Error reading file at 0x23762
</code></li>
<li>
Bit-Select expressions used with assignment operators such as +=, -=, |=, etc. sometimes caused errors like:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(9843) !is_cancelledOf(e)
</code></li>
<li>
Under certain circumstances, a port of a Verilog module always displays an X unless it is logged before any <b>run</b> command.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed in some cases if a non-blocking assignment update triggered a simulator <b>when</b> command, which in turn executed a <b>stop</b> command.</li>
<li>
If a SDF file referenced an instance name and a portname (in that order) that are identical, sdfcom crashed.
</li>
<li>
When a parameter with initial value as string literal was being overwritten by string concatenation using defparam, in vopt mode, sometimes its type was not being correctly identified as accStringParam. 
</li>
<li>
The "++" operator was broken for elements of associative arrays of long integers.  For example:
<br>      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longint a[longint];
<br>a[0] = 1;
<br>a[0]++; // a[0] should be 2 but it was being set to 0.</li>
<li>
Overriding the value of a parameter of type time would not work properly if the value used was a parent module's parameter value of type time.</li>
<li>
When using a module based bind in a Verilog design with a top-level configuration in effect, incorrect errors of the form "<i>name</i> already declared in the bind target scope." could be reported.</li>
<li>
Verilog conditional compilation now correctly ignores the text "`if/`else/`endif" when such text is embedded within a string literal.
</li>
<li>
If the simulator is elaborating a design unoptimized by vopt, and the design contains a Verilog configuration in which there is a cell-clause whose selected cell name is identical to the cell name specified in the associated use-clause, the simulator would fail to load the design after continuously attempt to reload the use-clause's cell for 75 attempts.
</li>
<li>
A Verilog optimized cell using input of net_type tri0/tri1 produced wrong simulation results.</li>
<li>
Killing a process that was waiting on a semaphore or mailbox could result in vsim crashing when that semaphore or mailbox became available.</li>
<li>
Fatal compile errors could result if $bits or similar was used within a generate loop to define the type of a declaration.</li>
<li>
SDF interconnect delay annotation failed silently in an optimized design if the source port resided in a module not containing a specify block and if <b>-v2k_int_delays</b> was not specified and if compiled SDF was not used. Primitives connected to the source port may have been optimized to a form not affected by the interconnect delay unless they were explicitly preserved with the vopt <b>+acc=u</b> option. They are now automatically preserved.</li>
<li>
The 0->x, 0->z, 1->x and 1->z transitions were not detected on RETAIN delays. This caused incorrect simulation results due to incorrect delay selection.</li>
<li>
Refresh of libraries containing comma-separated sensitivity lists now works in conjunction with the <b>-vlog95compat</b> switch.
</li>
<li>
If there is a continuous assignment to a register (i.e., a non-wire), and a 'force', followed by a 'release' is done on that register, the continuous assignment must then be re-evaluated.  This was not happening in earlier versions of vsim.</li>
<li>
Event schedules with negative relative delays could get handled differently depending on other non-related pending events.</li>
<li>
Compiling `protected code with vlog <b>-incr</b> sometimes generated the message:<br>
<code>This version of the compiler is incompatible with library file.
</code><br>
followed by a syntax error.</li>
<li>
The file I/O task $fgets returns an incorrect value when using long data with a multiple of 2048.</li>
<li>
SDF statements referencing conditions consisting of a mixture of argument and event conditions in a setuphold or recrem timing check may not annotate.</li>
<li>
begin_keywords issued an incorrect error when only non-variable items appeared in the $unit scope.
</li>
<li>
vopt could fail if multiple anonymous sequential blocks containing declarations appeared on the same source line.  This would typically be caused by macro-expansion of source containing distinct processes with sequential loops.</li>
<li>
The transaction recording API routine $add_attribute() now rejects attributes of type wire (net).  This restriction will be lifted in a future release.</li>
<li>
A latch implemented as an always block in an optimized design failed to propagate a data input change to the output in some cases if there was a following same iteration glitch on the enable from "closed" to "open" to "closed" again. Subsequently, when the enable changed again to "open" (no glitch), the new data input was not propagated to the output.</li>
<li>
An arithmetic shift right on a signed literal (or, any other signed constant expression) failed to zero fill the vacated bit positions when the shift expression appeared in a context where the signed expression must be converted to unsigned. For example, ((1'sb1 >>> 1) != 1'b0) evaluated to 1'b1, whereas it should have evaluated to 1'b0.</li>
<li>
vlog would occasionally crash when processing large designs that contain a <b>`uselib</b> directive and the <b>-compile_uselibs</b> switch.</li>
<li>
Use of <b>+delayed_timing_checks</b> could cause incorrectly timed notifier toggles of period and width timing check violations.</li>
<li>
Designs optimized with vopt which use SDF sometimes gave incorrect results.</li>
<li>
If an initial block contained $sdf_annotate statements that targeted protected regions they had to be the first items in that block. Now we allow other system tasks and non-blocking assignments to be interspersed with $sdf_annotate statements.</li>
<li>
Annotating a compiled SDF file containing 0 delay INTERCONNECTs in the presence of <b>+multisource_int_delays</b> switch sometimes caused a fatal error message or a crash.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Calling acc_object_of_type() with a named event (accNamedEvent) and accScalar would erroneously return TRUE.  This has been fixed so it returns FALSE.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
In vopt, we now detect and report an error for cases where a procedure call with a wait statement is called either directly or indirectly by a function call.  It is illegal for a function to be a parent of a subprogram that has a wait statement.</li>
<li>
In some cases, vopt crashed while optimizing a wait statement with no sensitivity list and an until expr that contained references to variables, but no signals.  The wait statement is a degenerate case that is equivalent to a simple "wait;" and generates a warning to that effect.</li>
<li>
Some subprogram calls, where the subprogram had local constant declarations whose initial value depended on a formal parameter declared with a default value, were incorrectly inlined.</li>
<li>
The compiler could issue an internal error (<code>** Error: test.vhd(14): Internal error: ../../../src/vcom/gendecl.c(44) current_process</code>) when a process contained a non locally static scalar SUBTYPE declaration with a range that was the same as that appearing in a prior FOR GENERATE generation scheme.
</li>
<li>
Added the <b>-deferSubpgmCheck</b> switch to vcom and vopt. This switch forces the compiler to report array indexing and length errors as warnings when encountered within subprograms. When subprograms with indexing and length errors are invoked during simulation, errors will be reported by the simulator. The additional checks can potentially slow down simulation.</li>
<li>
In rare cases, a signal array driven in a lower block failed to have its value propagated through instances of other block(s) instantiated at a higher level.
</li>
<li>
In rare cases, an optimization that merged processes with the same sensitivity list failed to resolve the signals driven.
</li>
<li>
When a slice of 9 elements of a driven std_logic_vector was passed to an output port, it would sometimes cause a crash depending on how it was driven at the lower level.
</li>
<li>
Method calls without arguments at the block level are now flagged as illegal concurrent statements. </li>
<li>
An elaboration time error could occur if a generic or port is of a user defined integer or real type. The error would occur only if the formal's value is an expression containing only literals and predefine operators.
The value of the formal could be provided by the actual or be the default value
if the formal is left open.</li>

The argument following <b>-sc_arg</b> could not have <b>-g</b> or <b>-G</b> as the first two characters.</li>
<li>
SystemC objects instantiated inside a try block in sc_main() were not debuggable.</li>
<li>
Using sc_int with sc_fixed was causing ambiguous operator overload errors.</li>
<li>
Concatenation of two sc_int larger than 32-bit was giving wrong results.</li>
<li>
sccom was unable to merge debug databases from two libraries if typedefs were used in template parameters.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Under certain conditions, applying compiled SDF to a design caused signal propagation failures across VHDL-System Verilog hierarchical boundaries.
</li>
<li>
Instantiation of a Verilog configuration from a VHDL design unit would sometimes fail to process the configuration's cell and instance statements.</li>
<li>
If vsim is used with the 2-step vopt flow (vopt is implicitly invoked), and if a VHDL design unit is instantiated from a library that has a name identical to the top-level design unit's name (from a different library), vsim may print the following error:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-8345) Unable to find original top-level design units for
optimized design "_opt".
</code>
<br>
If the design units are Verilog, simulation will proceed without error, but subsequent simulations may not reuse the optimized design.
</li>
<li>
When using vlog <b>-fast</b> on a module that instantiates two or more instances of some other module, where that module itself was compiled with <b>-fast</b> and instantiates a VHDL design unit via a fully expanded name (as escaped identifier, i.e., '\work.entity(architecture)&nbsp;'), vlog could crash.</li>
<li>
Verilog array of instances was not working properly at the Verilog-VHDL mixed language boundary when the VHDL component had ports of type array.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a crash in vsim with code coverage on.</li>
<li>
The Instance Coverage window displayed NULL in viewcov mode if the 
design has more than 500 flat instances and the selected environment 
has child instances at the end of the flat instance list.
</li>
<li>
Incorrect number of branches reported by <b>vcover report</b> command due to
overflow in counts.</li>
<li>
Fixed some problems with code coverage on, and running vsim with vopt. Any of
these problems could result in a vsim crash. These problems are related to
multiple instances of an inlined module, where some instances are optimized
differently than others. </li>
<li>
Multiple <b>-du</b> and <b>-instance</b> options are now supported in the <b>coverage save</b> command from simulation. </li>
<li>
Port direction of toggles was wrong in UCDB.</li>
<li>
There was a simulation mismatch between coverage flow and non coverage flow. The mismatch was because of overloading the "=" operator.</li>
<li>
The "Coverage Report" menu is added in Tools menu to have 
the new dialog box containing both Code Coverage and Functional 
Coverage items. The "Coverage Report" menu has three sub menus
for Text, HTML, and Exclusion report dialogs.</li>
<li>
An error message is added for detecting corrupted UCDB files by Windows 
by inserting control-M characters.</li>
<li>
The "Colorization Configuration" submenus are added in the RMB popup menus
from Browser and Tracker in the Verification Management GUI. This is to set
the low threshold and high threshold coverage values for highlighting 
coverage values in different Coverage columns with three different colors depending on the coverage values. If coverage value is less than the low threshold value then the coverage is highlighted in red, if the coverage
value is greater than the high threshold value then the coverage is highlighted
in green, otherwise coverage values are highlighted using yellow.</li>
<li>
Vector signals reported in the toggle coverage details page of the HTML coverage report were mis-parsed if the signal was a Verilog-style escaped identifier. The symptom is that the bits of the vector would all be reported with the same name and the bit number would be reported as the "alias" signal.</li>
<li>
Signals on the toggle details page of the HTML coverage report would be reported as uncovered (0.0%) if an alias for the signal also appeared at a higher level of hierarchy in the design.</li>
<li>
If an imported testplan section contains a path delimiter ("/"), it gets converted to a VHDL-style escaped identifier. This identifier would be copied to the Java-script based design navigation pane of the HTML report, causing the pane to fail to render.</li>
<li>
Fixed a number of problems related to code coverage and module inlining. This could cause a crash when running vsim with code coverage on. Also fixed some problems with code coverage and Generate Blocks. </li>
<li>
Implementation of the -code argument was reworked to fix bugs and give better error messages. For information on how to use this argument refer to the coverage or vcover command documentation (subcommands: tag, ranktest, stats).</li>
<li>
The UCDB SIMTIME attribute had the incorrect simulation time value.</li>
<li>
The vcover <b>merge</b> command did not maintain the size of test vectors correctly and caused an internal UCDB error in some cases.</li>
<li>
In the UCDB Browser, teststatus incorrectly showed "ok" rather than "merge_error" in some cases.
</li>
<li>
There is now a user-visible error message that appears during the merge
when two or more test records are merged with the same name but inconsistent data
values.

</li>
<li>
Absolute paths did not produce correct results with the coverage <b>-source</b> command and from the GUI.</li>
<li>
Compute-intensive coverage analyze queries may now be aborted with the break key.</li>
<li>
The current working directory of the simulation (from which a
UCDB is saved) is now recorded in the UCDB for later access by the test re-run
facility in the UCDB RUNCWD attribute.</li>
<li>
The command coverage <b>exclude -du</b> was not working correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Failures could occur when generating a compressed checkpoint or elaboration file greater the 4Gbytes in size.
</li>
<li>
In releases prior to 6.3d if the user used an alternate pathname to find their modeltech install tree (for example if they were running the same release on Windows and UNIX), optimized designs created with vopt might not be compatible, and would fail to load.</li>
<li>
Designs that contained references to libraries with embedded spaces in library pathname(s) might not load properly.</li>
<li>
A memory leak in the DPI routine svGetScopeFromName() was fixed.</li>
<li>
An error could occur when doing a "restore" if the "checkpoint" operation was done with an active context whose name contained extended identifiers(i.e. "\my test\").
</li>
<li>
vsim crashed if the installation directory had spaces in it and vsim was invoked with the <b>-c</b> switch.</li>
<li>
When /tmp or $TMPDIR is full, the simulation would keep running and lines written to the transcript file output would be lost. Now the simulation stops and prints an error. If /tmp is cleaned up, the simulation can then be resumed.</li>
<li>
Fixed the SAIF format as per LRM.
<ul>
<li>Changed VERSION to PROGRAM_VERSION.
<li>Escaping ()[]. (,) will be dumped as [,].
<li>Putting ( ) around the nets.

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Syntax highlighting may not function properly in the Source window (all the source is shown as plain text). You can fix this problem by editing ~/hte/v2_38/hte.ini (where ~ represents your "HOME" directory) and deleting the line that says:<br>
<code>
languages=cxx tcl verilog vhdl XML PSL
</code></li>
<li>
The viewcov mode version of "coverage clear" has a known difference in behavior compared to the vsim mode version.  In the viewcov mode version, clearing coverage data in a design unit instance does not affect the coverage data for that design unit, itself.  Also, if you clear coverage data in a design unit, all instances of that design unit are not affected by that operation.  In vsim mode, the data is more tightly linked such that one operation affects the other.  In viewcov mode, if you want to have correct data correlation between instances and design units, then you need to clear both instances and design units.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
Attempting to traverse from an unnamed VPI typespec handle to an instance or a scope will result in a crash.</li>
<li>
There are some limitations related to coverage exclusions:
<ul>
<li> Toggle exclusions are not supported in viewcov mode yet.
<li> Exclusion report on toggles are not supported in both vsim and viewcov mode.
</ul></li>
<li>
Concatenations and bit slices are not yet supported for System Verilog clocking blocks.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
When code coverage is on, and vopt is used with verilog module
inlining, instances within generate blocks will not show code coverage
data. This will be fixed in release 6.3e.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
File locking for UCDB merge:
<br>
We support a cumulative merge (vcover merge out.ucdb out.ucdb in.ucdb). Such merge requests may occur simultaneously from various platforms in a networking environment. In order to avoid corrupting cumulative coverage results, merges of UCDB files are serialized. "out.ucdb" is only written by a single process at a time. 
<ul>
<li>Creation of lock files whose purpose is to signal by their presence that a UCDB is locked for writing. 
<li>Operations are atomic. When creating the lock file, the process verifies that it does not exist and then creates it, but without allowing another process the opportunity to create it in the meantime. 
<li>The lock is advisory. Processes which intend to modify a UCDB file, by convention, check for locks to coordinate access to that file. The system fails if this convention is ignored. 
<li>There is a back-up file mechanism within vcover <b>merge</b> that, when optioned for, saves a back-up of the merge output before merging and can, when optioned for, automatically restore the back-up in case another process has its lock broken. 
<li>When blocked on a lock: 
<ul>
<li>We print out "Waiting for lock..." messages every so often and let the user explicitly break the lock if they think it safe. 
<li>We produce a message similar to: "User Bilbo on machine Frodo has had the lock for 16 days". 
<li>Retry attempts will occur every 10 seconds. 
<li>Blocked messages will repeat about every 3 minutes.
</ul>
<li>The lock is released after a time-out period: 
<ul>
<li>This cannot inadvertently time-out. 
Cannot be broken if a process is starved simply because others get in first. 
Time-out is only for the case where a single process takes too long. 
<li>The time-out period is user-configurable. 
<li>When a time-out condition occurs, the process timing out will be sent a "kill" signal. 
</ul>
</ul></li>
<li>
The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro body through the macro substitution process.
</li>
<li>
The vsim '-assertfile <file>' switch now only applies to assertion (VHDL/SVA/PSL) messages issued by the tool.  Use the vsim '-errorfile <file>' switch to redirect non-assertion tool messages into the specified file. To retain the tool’s previous behavior, set the environment variable MTI_ASSERTFILE_COMPATIBILITY to any value. This environment variable may eventually be deprecated.

In the modelsim.ini file, all “AssertionFormat” variables have been renamed as “MessageFormat” variables. The MessageFormat variables are valid for both assertion and non-assertion tool messages, as before.  For backward compatibility the AssertionFormat variables will continue to be supported.
</li>
<li>
The <b>restart</b> command will reload the current dataset if the current dataset is not the active simulation ("sim"), in effect acting just like a restart of a simulation.  See the <b>dataset restart</b> command below under "New Features".</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import configuration file (xml2ucdb.ini) has been moved from the product directory to a sub-directory, vm_src, directly below the product directory.</li>
<li>
The ucdb2html utility has been removed from the release. The HTML report functionality had been integrated into vcover for 6.3 (see <b>vcover report -html</b>).</li>
<li>
Due to changes required for resolution of product defects, the generated names of specializations of parameterized classes could be permuted.  For example, if a name such as "C::C__2" was previously used for "C#(int)" and "C::C__3" was used for "C#(logic)", the names might be exchanged.  The conditions under which
name permutation could occur are based on internal details of how specializations are matched and are not directly correlated to source descriptions.
</li>
<li>
The default action for the command <b>onbreak</b> has changed from "pause" to "resume". This will only impact dofiles that do not currently contain any <b>onbreak</b> commands. The "pause" action causes the macro file to stop executing and issues a "Paused" prompt to allow interactive debugging of the macro file.  The <b>resume</b> command continues the execution of the macro file at the point of the break. The result of this change in default value will affect macro files without an <b>onbreak</b> command so that those files will continue executing after hitting a break point. If the old behavior is required, then it will be necessary to add the command <b>onbreak pause</b> at the beginning of the macro file.</li>
<li>
The default collapsed mode for VCD output from the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command has changed from not collapsed to collapsed.  The specific change was to the line in the modelsim.ini file:  "DumpportsCollapse = 0".<br>
 
For 6.3, this was changed to:  "DumpportsCollapse = 1".<br> 
 
To get the old non-collapsed format, change this setting back to 0 in the modelsim.ini file.
</li>
<li>
Starting in 6.3 concatenations are no longer treated as 'assignment patterns'.  Previously, the simulator attempted to detect these cases and produced the following warning:<br>
<code>
You should use "'{" to specify this literal.
</code>
<br>
Now we will print errors, as in the following example:<br>
<code>
int a[3:0] = {default:0};
<br>int b[1:2] = {32'b1, 32'd2};
<br>...
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Can't use named concat. literals here.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Illegal concatenation of an unsized constant.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(31): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
<br>** Error: test2.sv(32): Cannot assign a packed type to an unpacked type.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Previously, an attempt to print a memory using $display displayed nothing, while $display of other unpacked types (such as structs and dynamic arrays) did produce output.  In 6.3, we will now print an elaboration error, #8323, for all such constructs (which are illegal).  This error may be suppressed.
<br>
To print unpacked data, we have added the "%p" and "%0p" format specifiers.  The former prints the data in the form of a legal "assignment pattern", while "%0p" prints in a shorter format.</li>
<li>
Wildcard indexed associative array can no longer be used as a foreach array.</li>
<li>
The IEEE Std 1800 has approved an important restriction to packages.  With the new rules, packages are not permitted to refer to compilation unit items.  An example of such of reference is the following small design:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>
Packages may depend on other packages so compilation unit declarations that packages need should be refactored into separate packages.  For example, the previous design should be changed to a form similar to the following:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

It is also important to note that "import" statements immediately before a package declaration are compilation unit imports and not imports into the subsequent package.  With the new rules, the package references may not look into such an import.  For example, the following approach will no longer work:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package shared_types;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       typedef int T;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    import shared_types::*;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    package p;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        T foo;   // cannot refer to T since it is imported into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 // the compilation unit, not into the package<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    endpackage
</code><br>

The new rules are now being enforced. Designs must be refactored
so that packages do not refer to anything in the compilation unit.
</li>
<li>
Version 6.3d includes the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System, which includes the following components:
<br>
InfoHub -- A browser-based directory that provides links to all your locally installed documentation. The InfoHub also provides a search interface, from which you can search across all your locally installed documents. The search interface also enables you to submit a search directly to SupportNet. The InfoHub provides access to User and Reference manuals and Tutorials, delivered in both HTML and PDF formats, and Release Notes, delivered in text format. 
<br>
PDF Bookcase -- A PDF file that provides links to the PDF documentation if you cannot use an HTML browser.
<br>
<br>
Improvements to the v2.1 Mentor Graphics Documentation System include the following:
<br>
Search changes -- Improved search time, multiple keyword support, search ranking icons, results filtering by book or topic, and improved accuracy of results.
<br>
Search and content scopes -- A new “My Search Scope” option lets you define a custom set of books to search.
<br>
Global index improvements -- improved viewing speed and collapse/uncollapse of "like" terms.
<br>
Getting Started movie -- provides an overview of all the features of the InfoHub and Mentor Graphic Documentation System. You can view the Getting Started (Movie) from the Quick Tips menu located in the lower left-hand corner of the InfoHub.
<br>
Font size -- increase or decrease the default size of the font by using the new triple "A" icon in the header.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=g</b> option has been replaced by the <b>+floatparameters</b> option(Verilog designs) and the <b>+floatgenerics</b> option (VHDL designs).  Both <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> accept the same [+&lt;module&gt;][.] syntax accepted by <b>+acc</b>.  Use <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> to instruct vopt not to lock down values of parameters and generics during optimization.  The parameters and generics will be left "floating", and thus capable of accepting modified values via the vsim <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options.  <b>+floatparameters</b> and <b>+floatgenerics</b> may have adverse effects on performance in some cases.</li>
<li>
The vopt <b>+acc=m</b> option has been changed such that it no longer preserves primitive instances. Primitive instances are now preserved by using the new <b>+acc=u</b> option.</li>
<li>
The VoptCoverageOptions variable has been removed from the modelsim.ini file.
vopt optimizations for coverage are now controlled by the CoverOpt modelsim.ini
file variable and the -cover command line option.</li>
<li>
The <b>-coverage</b> option to vopt is no longer needed. vopt will automatically detect whether any of the source files were compiled with a <b>-cover</b> option, and will adjust its optimizations accordingly. Also, if you give a <b>-cover xyz</b> option to vopt, it will be logically OR'd with any <b>-cover abc</b> option given to an individual source file when processing that source file. In addition, if you compiled some source files with coverage on, you can force coverage off by giving vopt the <b>-nocover</b> option.
This allows you to control whether coverage is on or off at vopt time instead of having to recompile individual source files.
</li>
<li>
The pathname reported by the simulator and User Interface for items inside SystemVerilog packages is incorrect. A path separator ('<b>/</b>') was used instead of the language correct package scope separator ('<b>::</b>').</li>
<li>
The recording of attributes for transactions has changed.  Previously,
any attribute recorded on a transaction was not only added to every
transaction on that same substream, but to all parallel transactions
and the transactions on their substreams as well.<br>

Now, any attribute recorded on a transaction is still added to every
transaction on that same substream, but is no longer automatically added
to every parallel transaction and the transactions on their substreams.
<br>

Typically, all transactions on a given stream (and all of it's parallel
substreams) have the same set of attributes, and for that case, there
will be no difference due to this change.</li>
<li>
Changes for <b>coverage exclude</b> command:<br>
<ul>
<li>Replace the option <b>-instance</b> with <b>-scope</b> to accommodate more scope types like generate block.
<li>Transition names are used with the option <b>-ftrans</b> instead of transition id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt;&lt;transition_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
where transition_name is specified as &lt;state_name&gt;-> &lt;state_name&gt;.
<li>State names are used with the option <b>-fstate</b> instead of state id's. The new syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state_name&gt;+ | all]<br>
</code>
<li>A new option <b>-else</b> is added to exclude the else part of every if-branch specified in the line range. Note that the line number for the else-branch is where the if-branch appears.
<li>Recursive exclusion for a scope is supported. To recursively exclude a scope, <b>-scope</b> is specified together with <b>-r</b>.
<li><b>-scope</b> and <b>-du</b> are supported with <b>-togglenode</b>.
</ul></li>
<li>
The UCDB bin name for if-branch is changed from 'true_branch' to 'if_branch'.</li>
<li>
The simulator has been improved to recognize and maintain Verilog escaped identifier syntax for all Verilog escaped identifiers. Previously such identifiers were converted to VHDL-style extended identifiers, and then appeared as VHDL extended identifiers in tool output and CLI commands.<br>

Starting in 6.3, all default Verilog escaped object names inside the simulator appear identical to their names in original HDL source files.<br>

Sometimes in mixed language designs, hierarchical identifiers might refer to both VHDL extended identifiers and Verilog escaped identifiers in the same fullpath. For example:<br>
<code>
/top/\VHDL*ext\/\Vlog*ext /bottom<br>
top.\VHDL*ext\.\Vlog*ext .bottom<br>
</code>
(depending if the HierPathDelim variable is set to '/' or '.')<br>

Any fullpath that appears as user input to the tool (e.g. on the vsim command line, in a .do file, on the vopt command line, etc.) should be composed of components with escape syntax appropriate to their language kind.<br>

A modelsim.ini variable called "GenerousIdentifierParsing" can control parsing of identifiers input to the tool. If this variable is set (it is set by default now), either escape syntax to be used for objects of either language kind. This can be helpful to maintain compatibility with older do files, which often contain pure VHDL extended identifier syntax, even for escaped identifiers in Verilog design regions.<br>

Note that SDF files are always parsed in "generous mode". SignalSpy function arguments are also parsed in "generous mode".<br>

On the vsim command line, the language-correct escape syntax should be used for top-level module names. Using incorrect escape syntax on the command line will work in the incr flow, but not in vopt. This limitation may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>
If an invalid end time is specified when recording the end of transaction, a warning is still issued but the current simulation time is used as the transaction end time instead of the transaction start time.</li>
<li>
The format of the library contents file (_info file) has been changed for the purpose of improved compiler performance. The new format is not backwards compatible with previous releases. Consequently, any attempt to refresh or recompile a 6.3 library with an older release will result in an error similar to the following:<br>
<code>
 ** Error: (vcom-42) Unsupported ModelSim library format for "./work". (Format: 3). 
</code>
<br>
Converting the library back to an older release requires that you remove the library and rebuild it from scratch. Or, if you are converting back to a 6.2 release only, then you can convert the library format to the 6.2 format and then freely refresh back and forth between 6.2 and 6.3 releases. Use the 6.3 version of vlib to convert the format to the 6.2 version using the <b>-format</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
vlib -format 1 work 
</code>
<br>
The format version for pre-6.3 releases is 1, while the format version for 6.3 is 3. Format version 2 is related to libraries created with the <b>-archive</b> option and should be avoided when specifying the vlib <b>-format</b> option.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import Utility (xml2ucdb) was enhanced and the command-line and configuration parameters were re-named for consistency. The following changes were made:
<ol>
<li>Command-line
  <ol>
  <li>Added a <b>-verbose</b> option to show testplan hierarchy and design mapping. By default, the utility is a lot less noisy than before.</li>
  <li>A <b>-ucdbfilename &lt;file&gt;</b> option has been added to remove the order-dependence of the files on the command line (the original syntax is still accepted).</li>
  <li>The command-line arguments are now order-independent.</li>
  <li>Any <b>-format &lt;format&gt;</b> option found on the command line is processed first and other extraction parameters found on the command line act as overrides on top of the parameters found in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The same parameter names are used both on the command line and in the configuration file.</li>
  <li>The <b>-tagseparators &lt;chars&gt;</b> option, when used on the command-line, applies only to the taglist parameters specified on the command line (see below).</li></ol></li>
<li>Configuration file
  <ol>
  <li>Added "datalabels" parameter to support user-defined embedded data labels.</li>
  <li>The following parameters have been re-named for consistency. In all cases, the former name is still recognized:
    <ol>
    <li>start => starttags</li>
    <li>stop => stoptags</li>
    <li>exclude => excludetags</li>
    <li>description => descriptiontag</li>
    <li>sectionitem => sectiontags</li>
    <li>dataitem => datatags</li>
    <li>testitem => titletag</li>
    <li>coveritem => linktag</li>
    <li>coverattr => linkattr</li></ol></li>
  <li>The "Tags" field name in the "fieldnames" and "fieldlabels" parameters has been renamed "Link". The former name is still recognized.</li></ol></li>
<li>Behavior
  <ol>
  <li>The UCDB tags used to link testplan sections to coverage items now has the contents of the "title" parameter prepended. Lacking that, the basename of the XML input file is used.</li>
  <li>The "startsection" parameter now reflects the initial section number for each level of hierarchy (auto-number mode only).</li>
  <li>Data capture is no longer enabled from the start of the document in auto- number mode. An element matching "starttags" or a section number matching the "startstoring" parameter is required to enable data capture.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
<li>
If the PATH column value is set to "-" it will be ignored (this is useful for the PATH-per-LINK case where one of the LINK values doesn't need a PATH).
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a "Path" column to direct testplan link item matching to a specific region of the design. In addition, a path may be prepended onto any CoverGroup, CoverPoint or Cross link item.<br>
For CoverPoint, CoverGroup, and Cross link items:<ul>
<li>If the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path information will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option to the tag command and the trailing component of the Link column will be parsed as usual and used to match the cover item. Any path added to the string in the Link column will be ignored.</li>
<li>If the Path column is not used or is left blank, and a path is prepended onto the string in the Link column, the prepended path will be used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option on the tag command.</li></ul>
For CoverItem, Assertion, or Directive link items:<ul>
<li>If the string in the Link column starts with a path separator character, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option in the tag command and no other tag command option is used.</li>
<li>If the string in the Link column does not start with a path separator (in other words, is not a full path), and the contents of the Path column are non-blank, the Path string is used as the value of the <b>-path</b> option and the Link strung is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the Link string is used as the value of the <b>-match</b> option on the tag command and no path is specified.</li></ul>
For all other link item types, the contents of the Path column are ignored.
Note: If the Path column for a given link item is the literal string "-", the Path column is ignored for that link item only.
</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports test data record tagging. If the Type column for a given link item is "Test", the contents of the Link column will be used as the value of the <b>-testrecord</b> option on the tag command associated with that link item.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports a <b>-stylesheet &lt;file&gt;</b> option ("stylesheet=<file>" in the INI file). This option points to an XSL transformation stylesheet which is applied to the imported XML file prior to extraction.</li>
<li>
XML Import (xml2ucdb) now supports XML files generated by Jasper's GamePlan testplan utility. Use the <b>-format GamePlan</b> option. </li>
<li>
Use of the "analog" format within the Wave window has been made easier by adding support for the use of <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> to control waveform scaling (the old method required use of "offset" and "scale").</li>
<li>
<h>Font Changes</h><br>
The way fonts are used and configured in the product has changed.  There are now 5 configurable fonts in the product: menuFont, textFont, fixedFont, treeFont, and footerFont.  These fonts are used by all windows and are customer configurable using the Edit Preferences dialog box.  The previous method of configuring fonts is no longer used and the preference variables will be ignored.  The Source window will continue to use it's own font setting as that window shares the font preferences with other products that use the DesignPad text editor.<br>
For current customers upgrading to 6.3b and later releases that have set up customized font preferences, these preferences will have to be manually configured for the new fonts, otherwise the product will look and behave just the same.</li>
<li>
A change to licensing  for this release eliminates extraneous entries in the license server log file that were the result of an availability check for a license feature.    There used to be a license checkout  line (i.e., OUT) followed by a license checkin line (i.e., IN) with 0 time duration each time the application checked on the availability of a license to decide whether to attempt the actual checkout of the license. </li>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GB.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default &lt;size&gt; unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either KB, MB or GB specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code>
vcd limit 6GB<br>
</code>

or<br>

<code>
vcd limit 400MB
</code></li>
<li>
Taglists (used as data extraction parameters) may now include a subset of the XPath syntax to identify elements not only by tag name but also by the contents of attributes attached to said elements. This pseudo-Xpath syntax only handles "=" and "!=" and can only examine the attribute values attached to the element being compared. Moreover, only one attribute comparison may be performed.<br>

For example, the following extraction parameter:
<xmp>"-starttags Worksheet[@ss:Name=Sheet1]"</xmp>
will match the following element in the incoming XML:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet1">...</Worksheet></xmp>
but will not match the following element:
<xmp><Worksheet ss:Name="Sheet2">...</Worksheet></xmp>
</li>
<li>
The behavior of several extraction parameters in the XML Import utility has been clarified to allow various parameters to work more independently. The affected parameters are: starttags, stoptags, excludetags, and startstoring.</li>
<li>
The <b>change</b> command can now be used to modify local variables in Verilog tasks and functions.</li>
<li>
There have been some performance improvements to the learn phase of the learn flow. The learn no longer learns individual bits.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.3d</b>
<ul>
<li>
A new command, <b>suppress</b>, was added to the simulator.  This extends the functionality of the existing vsim <b>-suppress</b> command line switch to allow controlling message suppression during simulation run-time.  The syntax is the same as the command line switch, with the addition of a <b>-clear</b> switch used for clearing message suppression.  The command can be used to suppress particular messages during a select period of a simulation, such as during design reset and initialization.</li>
<li>
The timeline in the Wave window can be configured to use a different time unit from the simulation time units.  Valid values are any time unit specifier (i.e. fs, ps, ns, us, ms, sec, min, hr).  The <b>-timelineunits</b> option is used either via the <b>configure wave -timelineunits</b> command or via the Wave window properties dialog box.  The current configuration is saved with the wave format file so it may be restored later.  The preference variable PrefWave(timelineunits) is used to define the default value if the window is not specifically configure otherwise.</li>
<li>
A "#" by itself in the first element of a testplan section (row) matching one of
the datatags parameter will cause that section (row) to be ignored as a comment.
Note that this only works if there are no explicitly-tagged data fields (like a
title) in the row.</li>
<li>
The <b>radix</b> and <b>add wave</b> commands and user interface have been updated to support a time radix for displaying Verilog registers as a time value.</li>
<li>
A new UCDB API call ucdb_GetToggleCovered() was added to compute whether a toggle node is covered.
</li>
<li>
Inline genvar declaration support has been added for System Verilog.  An example of this form is as follows:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (genvar i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
</code>
</li>
<li>
The simulator now supports non-blocking assignments through virtual interfaces inside class methods, as long as the resulting variable is a valid target.</li>
<li>
The XML Testplan Import tool, xml2ucdb, now has limited support for nested XML testplans. The parent XML file can specify a Link string of Type "XML" which contains optional command-line parameters and a path to another XML testplan file. The child testplan sections will be inserted as children of the parent section which called out the "XML" link.</li>
