   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 5.8
       release.
          + For Linux:
               o Linux  is  built  on  RedHat Enterprise Workstation 2.1.
                 This version is compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher.
               o RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will be supported for one release
                 with a new platform vco, called linux_rh60.
               o RedHat 9.0 is now supported (32-bit only).
               o AMD  Opteron  is  now  supported running SuSE SLES 9 (in
                 32-bit  mode  only). It is not recommended to run 32-bit
                 ModelSim on versions of SuSE earlier than 9.
               o Linux now supports large files.
          + For AIX:
               o AIX 5.2 is supported in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
               o rs64  is built on AIX 5.1 and, as such, supports AIX 5.1
                 and higher OS versions.
               o rs64 no longer supports AIX 4.3.
               o rs64  will  support  large  files if you are using a JFS
                 type file system and the large file option is enabled.
               o AIX version 4.2 is discontinued.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8  betas or 5.7x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating  your  Libraries"  in  the  ModelSim  Installation &
       Licensing Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.8b  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.8b release from
       5.7x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the vlog compiler currently supports some System Verilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two ways to enable System Verilog
       features  in vlog 5.8b: the first is by using the -sv command line
       option  and  the  second is by naming the source file with a ".sv"
       suffix.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * The Wave window did not remember scaling of analog signals.
     * The   mem   save  command  failed  for  datawords  wider  than  80
       characters.
     * The  List  window failed to reset the time unit for the simulation
       time column when a new design was loaded.
     * Source   window   object  value  popup  displays  of  arrays  with
       descending index ranges did not work correctly. Also, object field
       names  are  now displayed if the object is a VHDL record or System
       Verilog struct.
     * The  Variables  window  had  a  problem  when  viewing  a WLF file
       post-simulation (-view mode).
     * wlfman  did  not  recognize  shared  and  process variables in WLF
       files.  Variables  did  not  appear  in  the 'items' list and were
       ignored during a 'filter' operation.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * Variables declared inside of generate conditional constructs could
       give a compile error when written to.
     * Beginning  in  5.8, compile times increased for designs containing
       large numbers of hierarchical references.
     * Hierarchical  references to parameters inside optimized cells from
       separately  compiled  testbenches no longer cause sporadic crashes
       during design load.
     * Sometimes  a logged signal that was an input port annotated with a
       multisource  interconnect  delay would not log correctly; no value
       was found. This occurred only on the Windows platforms.
     * Non-blocking  assignments  within tasks or functions called with a
       hierarchical  reference  did  not  correctly  update  the intended
       variable if the assignment was not optimized.
     * Parameters  did  not  propagate  down  through generated instances
       correctly.
     * Mixed  designs  with  a VHDL top-level were not getting parameters
       propagated  correctly  into  Verilog  levels  containing  generate
       conditionals.
     * The  case  of  a  single  input  driving  two  different  nets  in
       continuous  assignments  and  a  second  net  being read inside an
       edge-triggered  always block gave a mismatch when the -fast option
       was used.
     * System functions that can return an EOF value are now signed. This
       allows  users to assume negative return values as error conditions
       for  these  functions  ($fgetc(), $ungetc(), $fscanf(), $sscanf(),
       $ftell()).
     * The -vlog95compat switch caused the word "static" to be treated as
       a  reserved keyword which resulted in a syntax error when "static"
       was used as an identifier.
     * The power operator (**) returned incorrect results for an exponent
       of  0 if the result length was larger than 32 bits. Only the lower
       32 bits were set, and the upper bits were left uninitialized.
     * An assignment to a partially out-of-bounds part-select of a vector
       register resulted in an internal compiler error.
     * SDF  annotation  of $width limits contained an implicit zeroing of
       the threshold limit which wasn't occurring for unoptimized cells.
     * A  continuous assignment having a right-hand side expression using
       '+',  '-', '*', '/', or '%' operators on scalar operands evaluated
       incorrectly in some cases.
     * A  fork-join block having a mix of parallel non-delayed statements
       and  parallel  zero-delayed  (#0)  statements  failed to guarantee
       execution  of  the  non-delayed statements before the zero-delayed
       statements.
     * Disabling  a  fork  with  active threads executing in named blocks
       caused a crash in some cases.
     * Expressions  of the form (~A & ~B) and (~A | ~B) sometimes had the
       wrong value.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * Case  statements  with  locally  static  case expressions were not
       compiled  correctly if at least one choice was a range (e.g., 0 TO
       5).
     * The  compiler,  when run with the -lint option, will now produce a
       warning  if  the  actual  expression  associated with a subprogram
       formal  parameter  of  an  unconstrained array type is an implicit
       concatenation operation. The warning will serve as a reminder that
       the   1993   rules  for  implicit  concatenation  are  being  used
       regardless   of   the   specified   language  version  (VHDL-1987,
       VHDL-1993,  or  VHDL-2002). This is a VHDL compiler change related
       to DR 00162274.
     * Incorrect   size   mismatch   errors  could  be  generated  during
       elaboration under the following conditions:
          + The size of an entity's port depends on a generic.
          + The entity is directly instantiated.
          + The port is assigned a literal expression.
       If  these conditions were met then an error message similar to the
       follow message was generated.
       "  **  Fatal:  (vsim-3590)  (line 17): Array with index bounds (-1
       downto 0) (null range) is length 0; string is length 4."
     * ModelSim  crashed  while  loading  a  design  on  win32  or  linux
       platforms   with   the  message  "Fatal  cg:  register  allocation
       failure." The problem was related to range bounds checks.
     * In  SE,  if  a  sequential  process's  sensitivity  list contained
       signals  other than the clock and reset signals and one or more of
       the extra signals was a vector, then incorrect simulation may have
       occurred.  The  simulation  error  appeared  as  if the sequential
       process failed to evaluate.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.8b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * VITAL cells with more than 256 path delays caused the simulator to
       crash.  Modelsim will now generate a warning and the cell will not
       be accelerated.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * SystemC  is  now  supported  on  RedHat  Linux  versions  7.2, and
       Enterprise  Workstation  version  2.1,  in  addition  to the Linux
       versions  already  supported.  gcc  3.2.3 is required on these new
       platforms and can be downloaded from the MTI Web site.
     * sccom  errored  out  promptly  on HP-UX for non-aCC users when the
       user had set CppPath pointing to gcc/g++ in the modelsim.ini file.
     * Attempting  to  set  a  breakpoint dot in the Source window gave a
       misleading error message from the C Debug tool. This happened on a
       non-supported SystemC platform.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 5.8b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * Mixed designs with a VHDL top-level could crash during elaboration
       when lower-level Verilog modules contained generate conditionals.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8b
     * wlfman filter crashed on Windows.
     * The  tssi2mti  command  exited  with a return status of 8 when the
       number  of  force  statements  printed was a multiple of 101. This
       caused the ModelSim user interface to report the following error:
       ** Error: child process exited abnormally
     * Reading  an  invalid  enumeration value using the TEXTIO procedure
       read() caused the simulator to crash.
     * vsim  crashed  when  restart  -f was issued during simulation of a
       pre-elaborated design (-elab/-load_elab)
     * In  Windows  98 and ME systems, the vmap command returned an error
       similar to:
       Copying c:/modeltech/win32/../modelsim.ini to modelsim.ini
       Modifying modelsim.ini
       Error: This function is only valid in Win32 mode
     * ModelSim  crashed  while loading a design with the message "Fatal:
       cg: double register allocation failure".
     * "vsim  -lib /tmp/nonexist simple" would crash the simulator if the
       library /tmp/noexist did not exist.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.8b
     * DR  00164994  -  examine -radix was not implemented in the C Debug
       tool.
     * DR  00166088  -  ModelSim crashes on loading a Verilog design with
       generate statements.
     * DR 00161863 - Modelsim 5.8 compilation hangs while 5.7 is ok.
     * DR  00162274  -  Bits  in  bus  reversed  so  results do not match
       ModelSim 5.5.
     * DR 00163070 - Crash on HP 64-bit : # ** Fatal: cg: double register
       allocation failure.
     * DR  00165095  -  Wave  window  :  format analog step -scale factor
       doesn't work.
     * DR  00165195  -  ModelSim  crashes  when restart is used if we use
       -elab for elaboration.
     * DR  00165354  -  ModelSim does not allow 'static' to be used as an
       identifier when using -vlog95compat.
     * DR 00165672 - Incorrect Simulation result.
     * DR 00165493 - Problems With Co-simulation on RH Linux WS 3.0.
     * DR 00164686 - ModelSim's mem save command crashes.
     * DR  00163083  -  ModelSim  does  not  pick the correct conditional
       "when"  statement  when  a constant is being used as the index for
       case statement.
     * DR  00162171  -  vsim  crashed  when  library compiled with +opt &
       design compiled separately.

   Known Defects in 5.8b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 5.8b
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8b
     * A new subcommand for find has been added. find instances will find
       instances  in  the  current region which match the search pattern.
       The usage is:
       find instances [-r] <pattern>
     * vsim -restore is now allowed in GUI mode.
     * The   vlog  switch  -instantiateReadOnly  allows  Verilog  modules
       compiled  with  -fast  to instantiate modules or UDPs from library
       directories  which  have  read-only permission. The instantiations
       will not be inlined or further optimized.
     * The  vsim option +delayed_timing_checks causes timing checks to be
       performed  on  the  delayed  versions of input ports. This is used
       when there are negative timing check limits.
     * VHDL configurations now support loading Verilog configurations and
       vice versa.
