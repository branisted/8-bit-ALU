<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The individual bits of a delayed virtual bus were not displayed with the proper delay value, even though the bus was displayed properly in the Wave window. Also,   waveform compare with a delayed bus did not compare properly. </li>
<li>
The "Window" drop down menu on the menu bar of the Source window was missing when the window was undocked. This menu has been added.
</li>
<li>
Interactive font changes to the Transcript window did not effect all prompt labels in the window.</li>
<li>
The Objects window sometimes displayed incomplete lists or drew poorly in <b>-view</b> mode when the default sort was ascending or descending.</li>
<li>
Some font specifications in a users .kderc file caused an invocation error in the simulator.
</li>
<li>
In some cases the Control-F shortcut did not behave as expected and opened multiple Find dialog boxes or did not work at all.</li>
<li>
In some cases Control-X and Control-V did not work in the Source window Find dialog box.</li>
<li>
The Save Format dialog box was too narrow for reasonable pathname entry.  The entry box has been made wider to accommodate longer pathnames.</li>
<li>
On the Windows platform, choosing File->exit or selecting the 'X' in the upper right of the Main window failed to exit when a simulation was loading or running.</li>
<li>
Double-clicking on a compile error in the Transcript window did not bring up the source and highlight the error.</li>
<li>
The Edit Breakpoint dialog box previously allowed you to change the line number and file number if you invoked it by clicking on a line. Now these fields are editable only if you are creating a new breakpoint, otherwise they are read-only.</li>
<li>
The F3 function key in the Source window now does a "find next", as it used to do in 6.1.  The "maximize window" action now uses F5 instead of F3. The "activate next window" action now uses F4 instead of F2.</li>
<li>
The Call Stack window stopped responding to mouse clicks after the window was invoked and then clicking the mouse in the Structure window. After a single-step operation it started responding again.</li>
<li>
Clicking on the "+" to expand dynamic arrays in the Variables window (after the array was allocated) did not expand the array.</li>
<li>
The "Files" tab in the workspace pane did not show all the files for design units.  In the case of Verilog `include files, only the first file was shown when more then one file existed.</li>
<li>
When the Call Stack window was invoked while vsim was loading, the
Call Stack window was displayed as a gray window frame.</li>
<li>
The text box for the <b>breakpoint</b> command, which is located in the signal breakpoint and file breakpoint dialog boxes did not support the functions cut, copy, paste and delete. These functions have been added in a popup menu.</li>
<li>
Fatal and failure messages in the Transcript window were not colorized correctly.  </li>
<li>
The File List pane was updated to the top of the pane (without expansion) when the user selected exclude missed coverage. This caused the "file context" to change and the user was required to reset the context by hand to exclude more missed coverage.</li>
<li>
Clicking in the Wave windows, waveform pane caused incorrect highlighting in 6.2e.</li>
<li>
The Wave window drag and drop function crashed if an object was dragged from the value column in the Objects window and dropped in the value column of the Wave window.</li>
<li>
A Wave window drag and drop function could "lose" a wave group if it was dragged from the name column and dropped into the value column or visa versa.</li>
<li>
The mouse cursor was flashing when Objects were dragged from the Source windows to Watch window.</li>
<li>
On the Windows platform, if the kernal exited unexpectedly, such as when there is insufficient memory, the GUI closes so quickly that the user can not read the error message. If the simulator is launched from a desktop icon, there is not a console or shell listing the message after the simulation closes. The GUI now brings up a dialog box notifying the user of the exit code. The dialog box closes automatically after 10 seconds.</li>
<li>
Signals displayed with analog format in the Wave window sometimes had erroneous glitches.</li>
<li>
The capitialization of words in Dataflow window menu picks were not consistent with the rest of the GUI.</li>
<li>
The <b>vcd add</b> command has been extended with the <b>-dumpports</b> switch. When the <b>vcd dumpports</b> command cannot specify all ports that will appear within the VCD file, multiple <b>vcd add -dumpports</b> commands can be used to specify the ports.</li>
<li>
Coverage exclusion by instance using a Right Mouse Button click 
in the Missed Coverage window, did not work.</li>
<li>
On the Windows platform, when a file was added to a project, and the pathname contained an environment variable, certain operations on the file in the project did not work properly.  </li>
<li>
The project setting "Convert pathnames to softnames", is found on the project properties dialog box. It did not change pathnames correctly. All project files are now converted to softnames, if possible, otherwise they are converted to a hard pathname. This feature is only used when MGC location maps are used.</li>
<li>
If either of the vsim command line options <b>-msgmode</b> or <b>-wlfslim</b> were used with the <b>-load_elab</b> option vsim mistakenly reported an error message such as:<br>
<code>
** Error: Argument -msgmode is incompatible with -load_elab
</code>
<br></li>
<li>
Source code annotation did not show up for verilog files with ansi style task declarations.  This has been fixed.</li>
<li>
Errors like the following could occur if more than 10 Wave Window bookmarks are defined and the bookmarks pulldown menu is generated: "# CheckMenuAccelerator: 10 mem bus .mBar.activewindowx.bookmarks accelerator "#10" is invalid".  This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
A task call was incorrectly optimized away in some cases if the task called a function that modified state variables external to the function.</li>
<li>
Hierarchical references prefixed with $root from within packages did not produce an error.</li>
<li>
When initializing a dynamic array vopt erroneously issued the error:<br>
<code>
Initialization array for 'new' must match array being set.
</code></li>
<li>
An incorrect value would be reported in an eVCD file when a port was driven against its direction.</li>
<li>
Incorrect errors could occur when running vopt on a design with $signal_spy.</li>
<li>
In a class specialization, referencing a package localparam of a dynamic type (such as string) could result in a fatal error from vopt.</li>
<li>
Assertion messages produced by methods of a parameterized class could produce an incorrect file name.</li>
<li>
Using $fscanf with the %d format now handles register arguments larger than 32 bits correctly.  Previously only the least significant 32 bits were loaded from the converted string.</li>
<li>
The conditional operator in SystemVerilog when used with a string type and a string literal compiled successfully but produced incorrect simulation results.  An example of code that failed is:<br>
<code>
 ' tmp = valid ? bar : "<No value>"; ',
</code>
<br>
where bar is of string type.</li>
<li>
Incorrect file names were displayed in error messages originating from within `include files.</li>
<li>
The $signal_force system task was not correctly checking the validity of the 4th argument, force_type.  The task expected an integer but silently allowed other argument types like string.</li>
<li>
In some cases vopt could fail when inlining modules from different SystemVerilog compilation units.</li>
<li>
An error was not reported when a static declaration was initialized with an expression containing automatic variables.</li>
<li>
The evaluation of arguments to system functions ($signed, for example) resulted in memory leaks in some cases. Usually, the leak occurred only if the argument was an operation involving operands having sizes dependent on parameters in non-optimized mode.</li>
<li>
The $cast system task was overly restrictive in allowing only simple variable expressions for the first argument. It has been extended to support all valid lhs expressions.</li>
<li>
Bit-selects and part-selects of a localparam having an explicit range specified in its declaration with both bounds being non-zero evaluated to incorrrect results in non-optimized mode.</li>
<li>
When an undefined variable name was referenced in complex expressions, vopt in some cases generated internal errors like:<br><code>
** Error: test.sv(37): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(118) vl_save_stack_on_wait<br>
vlog: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c:486: vopAddr: Assertion 
  `vop->tmpaddr.regno!=FP_REL || vl_save_stack_on_wait' failed.
</code></li>
<li>
Disabling Verilog fork blocks sometimes left one or more fork processes running.</li>
<li>
Calling pre-defined class methods such as get_randstate() in the argument list to system tasks or functions sometimes generated an internal error during compilation.</li>
<li>
Overriding a non-virtual class method with a virtual class method in the subclass caused vsim to crash.</li>
<li>
vopt performed optimizations on virtual class method calls based on the compile-time definition of the method being called, but some optimizations were not valid for derived implementations of the virtual method. This resulted in code in the derived class being skipped in certain cases.</li>
<li>
In certain cases class methods defined in packages incorrectly reported the error: <br>
<code>
Actual argument expression for ref formal '(null)' is not an equivalent type.
</code>
<br>
even though the arguments provided for the ref parameter were valid.</li>
<li>
Referencing class properties from within a fork..join_none or join_any block crashed vsim in some cases.</li>
<li>
An error was not reported for an illegal reference into a package using a hierarchical path (package_name.reference) instead of a legal package reference (package_name::reference).</li>
<li>
An error could be reported for a legal reference to a class method when the class object was made visible by an import from a package.</li>
<li>
An escaped identifier over 1024 characters in length for a module name resulted in a compiler crash.</li>
<li>
A relational operator with an operand denoted by a hierarchical access to a memory  erroneously reported the following error:
<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-3978) ...: Cannot mix packed and unpacked types in this operation.
</code>
</li>
<li>
A delayed non-blocking assignment maturing at the same time as a non-delayed non-blocking assignment to the same target variable failed to update the variable in the same order that the assignments were executed (the LRM requires that they execute in FIFO order, and the final value of the variable should be that scheduled by the non-delayed non-blocking assignment).</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog class copy constructor failed to assign the new class handle when the left-hand side expression was an array element or the field of a class or structure.</li>
<li>
Use of #0 delay in verilog task could cause vsim to assert if the task got called in the reactive region.</li>
<li>
Fixed various issues with compiling System Verilog designs with the -u option.</li>
<li>
The -u compile option has been extended to make reserved words case insensitive (previously, only identifiers were uppercased) to be compatible with other simulator's implementation of -u.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Assignments to variables at scopes outside of subprograms should have suppressed an optimization that converted those variables to constants.</li>
<li>
For certain designs containing generics, vcom and vopt could get stuck in an internal loop.</li>
<li>
Running vcom with the <b>+acc</b> option in its simplest form (with only the four characters "+acc") gave an error about an unknown option.</li>
<li>
A Vital level 1 optimized compilation in conjunction with the <b>-nodebug</b> option resulted in the erroneous fatal error 3067 when loading the design.</li>
<li>
The compiler could erroneously treat a slice name as a trivial slice if the subtype of the sliced object had an index range containing an attribute name whose prefix was of an access type and if the slice discrete range was lexically the same as this index range.</li>
<li>
An overloaded "=" operator was not being handled correctly when compiled with expression coverage (-cover e) and produced incorrect simulation results.  The "=" operator was assumed to return a boolean result, but the overloaded version returned a std_logic result.  An erroneous type conversion was being performed as a result.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The FLI function mti_CreateRegion() always converted the region name to lowercase.  Now it this function maintains the case if the parent is Verilog or SystemC, and converts it to lowercase it if the parent is VHDL.</li>
<li>
On 64-bit platforms only, in certain cases when passing parameters to C using a FLI concurrent procedure call, the C code ended up with an incorrect parameter value.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
Elaboration of a module failed when the module contained a Verilog generate block encompassing instantiation of a VHDL design unit that had been specialized by vopt, due to the presence of generics that could be inferred to be constants.
</li>
<li>
In the case where a VHDL design unit instantiated a Verilog module, if the Verilog module had a parameter initialized to an empty string, i.e., "", and the actual generic in the VHDL instantiation statement was a string type with the value "", the simulator crashed during loading of the design.</li>
<li>
An error message was added for the unsupported Dot-Star ".*" syntax for port connections at the SystemC-Verilog and VHDL-Verilog mixed-language boundary.</li>
<li>
Instantiation of VHDL design units from within a Verilog generate region might cause vopt to incorrectly issue the following error message:

<pre>
**Error: Direct or indirect circular dependency between packages
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The Verilog system task $coverage_save did not save UCDB files.</li>
<li>
Condition coverage and expression coverage now do more checking for literal
constants and reduce the expressions and truth tables accordingly.</li>
<li>
vcover failed to report coverage data for instances and design units that only contained toggle data. 
</li>
<li>
When compiled with expression coverage, a VHDL model using overloaded relational operators, e.g., "=", incorrectly applyed type conversion to the return value and generate incorrect results.   </li>
<li>
vcover merge reports produced errors if the UCDB files have any code coverage data under SystemVerilog interface or program blocks.</li>
<li>
Expressions and conditions appear in the Missed Coverage window in viewcov mode even when all the rows are covered.</li>
<li>
vcover merge could not find VHDL target instances if the source instance
names had different case.</li>
<li>
Generated instance names from the <b>vcover merge -du</b> command contained incorrect path separator characters when the work library name is a full path.</li>
<li>
vcover merge prints errors when a source DU has multiple instances, 
but the corresponding target DU has only one instance.</li>
</ul>

If the Signal Spy signal_release() function was called on a signal that was not previously forced (via the GUI <b>force</b> command or Signal Spy signal_force function) a fatal error occurred in certain cases.</li>
<li>
When vsim incountered a fatal error at load time, vsim did not always stop the loading process.</li>
<li>
The SystemVerilog $display function limited string length to 30,000 characters.

<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.</li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
The automatic invocation of the design-wide performance optimization tool "vopt" has been enabled. Upon invocation, the simulator determines if vopt has been run on the top-level module(s) you supplied; if not, the simulator invokes vopt and outputs a message similar to: 
<br>
# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized... 
<br>
The optimization step will improve run time performance and affect the visibility of objects in the design. To enable debug visibility it is recommended you add additional options to vopt on the vsim invocation via the -voptargs argument.  For example: vsim <b>-voptargs</b>="+acc" which enables full debug access to objects in the optimized design. To understand the full usage of <b>+acc</b> and <b>-voptargs</b>, please refer to the chapter "Optimizing Designs with vopt" in the User's Manual for more information. 
<br>
If required you may obtain the previous behavior of vsim, where it does not perform performance optimizations, by setting the modelsim.ini variable "VoptFlow" to 0 (zero). An alternative to setting VoptFlow to zero, where interactive debug compile throughput is required you can use the <b>-novopt</b> option on the vsim and compilation command line (vcom/vlog).</li>
<li>
The Watch window has changed the format for some kinds of objects.  Composite objects are now displayed in an expanded form.  The display box also will have scrollbars if necessary and is also resizable.</li>
<li>
vlog or vopt will now display a warning if cross coverage produces redundent results.</li>
<li>
A stacktrace will no longer be printed when a fatal error is the result of incorrect user code and the fatal error is recoverable. Instead, the simulation  stops and the failing source code line is reported.</li>
<li>
Due to customer requests, statement coverage has been added for
VHDL concurrent conditional signal assignments and selected signal
assignments.</li>
<li>
The User Interface was modified to suppress the display of implicit wires in the Structure and Process windows. The debugger will not step into implicit wire processes when the display of implicit wires is suppressed. This behavior is controlled by a preference variable, PrefMain(HideImplicitWires). When this variable is set to 0 (zero) it displays implicit wires and allows the debugger to step into them and when it is set to 1 (the default), it hides them and suppresses debugger interaction with them.</li>
<li>
Breakpoint and Fatal error messages have changed.  They now display the name of the function, task, subprogram, module, or architecture where the condition occurred, in addition to the file and line number.  This additional information should make it easier to debug.  This old message format can be enabled for backward compatibility by modifying the modelsim.ini variable ShowFunctions. Setting this to 0 will revert the messages to the previous format.</li>
<li>
The <b>see</b> command has been enhanced.  It will now accept 1 or 2 arguments.  These arguments are the number of source file lines to display before and after the current execution line.  The <b>see</b> command has also been made available in GUI mode in addition to command line mode.<br>
<code>
    see    ;# Display source file lines around the current execution line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;# By default 5 lines before and 4 lines after are displayed<br>

    see &lt;n&gt;  ;# Display &lt;n&gt; lines before and after the current line.
<br>
    see &lt;pre&gt; &lt;post&gt; ;# Display &lt;pre&gt; line before and &lt;post&gt; lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;# after the current line<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
Temporary compiler files are now always created in the current "work" library
under a directory called _temp.  Previous versions created files in /tmp or
/var/tmp and failed in some cases if the given machine did not have a large amount of disk space allocated to the partitions that contained these directories.
</li>
<li>
The WLF reader cache feature is now enabled by default.  This feature was introduced in version 6.1, but was disabled by default.  Refer to User's Manual for more information about the WLF reader cache.</li>
<li>
The shell commands vcom, vlog, vsim, vmap, no longer expand environment variables in filename arguments and options.  Instead, variables should be expanded by the shell before hand, in the usual manner.  The <b>-f</b> option that most of these commands support, now performs environment variable expansion throughout the file.
<br>
Environment variable expansion is still performed in the following places:
<ul>
<li>Pathname and other values in the modelsim.ini file.
<li>Strings used as file pathnames in VHDL and Verilog.
<li>VHDL Foreign attributes.
<li>The PLIOBJS environment variable may contain a path that has an environment variable.
<li>The Verilog `uselib file and dir directives.
<li>Anywhere in the contents of a <b>-f</b> file.
</ul>
The recommended method for using flexible pathnames is to make use of the MGC Location Map system.  When this is used, then pathnames stored in libraries and project files (.mpf) will be converted to soft names.
<br>
If a file or path name contains the dollar sign character ($), and must be used in one of the places listed above that accepts environment variables, then the explicit dollar sign must be escaped by using a double dollar sign ($$).
<br>
To revert to the old behavior in the event that this is necessary for existing flows, set the modelsim.ini variable "DepricatedEnvironmentVariableExpansion" to 1. This variable must be set in the appropriate section ([vcom], [vlog], or [vsim]) to revert the behavior in the corresponding tool.</li>
<li>
The Scroll Wheel behavior has changed for the Dataflow window.  It no longer scrolls the window up or down.  Instead, the scroll wheel will zoom In (wheel down) or zoom Out (wheel up). The window will also center on the mouse location as it zooms.</li>
<li>
In include file "svdpi.h", the definition of the fields in the svLogicVecVal struct has been changed.  As per IEEE P1800 SV-CC item #883, the two fields in that struct have been renamed from a and b to aval and bval, respectively.

To help ease this transition, you can add -DP1800_2005_VECVAL to your C compiler command line.  That will give you the old field names until you have the chance to change your source code to conform with the new naming.</li>
<li>
The <b>write report</b> command has been changed to list all source files used to compile a given design unit, not just the main file containing the module keyword.</li>
<li>
A "Compile selected files together" checkbox has been added to the Compile Source Files dialog.  It allows user choice of whether to compile all selected files in one compiler invocation or a separate invocation for each file.  You can change the default using the Preferences dialog or by editing the PrefCompileDialog(multiFileCompile) variable in the <i>pref.tcl</i> file.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage save</b> command writes UCDB files and the <b>-XML</b>
switch is no longer supported with the new functional coverage flow. Also the 
<b>coverage reload</b> command is no longer supported, the users
can use the view mode of vsim to see their coverage results in the GUI.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage save</b> command now saves data in the UCDB format (see note under New Features); the old code coverage format can no longer be saved, though it can still be processed with the standalone utility "vcover".  The old functional coverage format will likewise no longer be saved with "fcover save", and a UCDB will be saved instead.
</li>
<li>
If you run <b>vsim -voptargs=...</b> and then within vsim invoke
vsim again: previously the <b>-voptargs</b> argument would be
copied down and remain in effect. This is no longer the case. It is now
reset before each invocation.</li>
<li>
The Find dialog in the Objects, Locals and Dataflow windows now has a <b>Find All</b> button.</li>
<li>
A <b>-coverage</b> option has been added to vopt for running vopt
directly and adjusting options to correctly handle code coverage. When running
vopt implicitly through vsim nothing needs to be done: the
<b>vsim -coverage</b> option will make the needed adjustments.</li>
<li>
Increase timing check capacities for optimized Verilog cells.</li>
<li>
The following interfaces of registering a SystemVerilog SystemC DPI function have been renamed.<br>
<ul>
<li>"sc_export_function" has been changed to "sc_dpi_register_cpp_function"
<li>"SC_EXPORT_FUNCTION" has been changed to "SC_DPI_REGISTER_CPP_FUNCTION"
<li>"sc_export_member" has been changed to "sc_dpi_register_cpp_member_function"
<li>"SC_EXPORT_MEMBER" has been changed to "SC_DPI_REGISTER_CPP_MEMBER_FUNCTION"
</ul></li>
<li>
Progress information for loading dataflow is now displayed in the dataflow window's footer.</li>
<li>
A SystemC sc_out port connected to a HDL signal higher up in the design hierarchy is now treated as a pure output port. A read() operation on such a sc_out port might give incorrect values.  Use a sc_inout port to do both read() and write() operations.</li>
<li>
The Active Processes window now loads only those processes it needs for display.  This provides better interactive performance on designs with a large number of active processes when selecting a process from the Structure or Dataflow window.</li>
<li>
Error messages in the VHDL compiler now report the full selected names when
reporting on types. The old format for these error messages was:<br>
<code>Error file.vhd(46): Constant "udelay" is type vitaldelaytype01; expecting type vitaldelaytype01"<br></code>
The new format for these error messages is:<br>
<code>Error file.vhd(46): Constant "udelay" is type ieee.vital_timing.vitaldelaytype01; expecting type vital2000.vital_timing.vitaldelaytype01"<br></code>
</li>
<li>
There are three FLI/PLI query routines that allow an application to programmatically determine the simulator product name and version at run time. These are mti_GetProductVersion(), acc_product_version() and vpi_get_vlog_info(). The strings they return have been changed slightly. The reason for the change is to make the returned strings more predictable both across the routines themselves, and across products and product versions.

When the above routines return a product name, they will return strings that start either "ModelSim" or "ModelSim for Questa". Thus a query to match "ModelSim" in the first 8 characters will match for both the ModelSim and QuestaSim simulators. To differentiate the Questa simulator, it is necessary to search for the string "Questa" somewhere in the product name. The ModelSim simulator will not have the string "Questa" in its product name.

The product name string contains other product-differentiating information too, not detailed here. 

The product version is returned as a separate string in the VPI routine. In the other two routines it is returned as part of the same string, with the syntactic separator " Version " between the product name component and the version number component.

The TCL command, vsimVersionString, is unaffected by this change.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage exclude</b> command syntax has been changed to better accommodate FSM coverage. The new syntax is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>    coverage exclude [-clearall | -addall][-code bcefst][-dataset &lt;name&gt;]
<LI>    coverage exclude [-clear] [-dataset &lt;name&gt;][-srcfile &lt;source_file&gt;]<br>
                     [-instance &lt;inst_path&gt; | -du &lt;du_name&gt;][-code bcefs]<br>
                     [-linerange &lt;ln&gt;+ | &lt;ln&gt;-&lt;ln&gt;+ | all]<br>
                     [-condrow | -exprrow &lt;ln&gt; &lt;rn&gt;+ | &lt;rn&gt;-&lt;rn&gt;+ | all]<br>
                     [-ftrans &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;trans_id&gt;+ | &lt;trans_id&gt;-&lt;trans_id&gt;+ | all]<br>
                     [-fstate &lt;state_var_name&gt; &lt;state#&gt;+ | &lt;state#&gt;-&lt;state#&gt; | all]<br>
</UL>
The <b>coverage exclude</b> can be used to do 'toggle disable' and 'toggle enable'(with -clear).
<UL> 
<LI>    coverage exclude [-clear] -togglenode &lt;node_path&gt;+
                     [-in] [-out] [-inout] [-internal] [-ports] [-r]<br>
</UL>
Note that the new 'coverage exclude' functionality is not fully supported yet. FSM exclusions will not reflect in the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.2f</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added new system functions $system and $systemf:
<br>
<ul>$system("command") will take one string argument and run the OS command.</ul>
<ul>$systemf(list_of_args) can take any number of arguments. The list_of_args is treated exactly same as $display(). The OS command that will be run is the final output from $display() given the same list_of_args.</ul>
Return values of both system functions are 32-bit integer and set to be the exit status code of the underlying OS processes. Note that there is a known issue in the return value of these two system functions on win32 platform. If the OS command is built with cygwin compiler, the exit status code may not be reported correctly when an exception is thrown and thus the return code may be wrong. The workaround is to avoid building the application using cygwin or using the switch "-mno-cygwin" in cygwin gcc command line.
</li>
<li>
Added the vsim command line switch <b>-printsimstats</b> and the modelsim.ini variable "PrintSimStats". When either one is turned on, the "simstats" result will be printed out at the end of the simulation session. The default is off.

</li>
<li>
Added a vsim command line switch <b>-onfinish mode</b>. The argument "mode" can have the following values "ask", "stop", or "exit". This swtich customizes vsim kernel shutdown behavior at the end of the simulation. The default mode is "ask". The meaning of the different modes are:
<UL>
<LI>"ask"  -- In batch mode, the vsim kernel will abruptly exit.  
          In GUI mode, a dialog box will pop up and ask for user confirmation 
          whether or not to quit the simulation.
<LI>"stop" -- Causes the simulation to stay loaded in memory.
<LI>"exit" -- The simulation will abruptly exit without asking for any confirmation.
</UL>

The modelsim.ini variable "OnFinish" accepts the same arguments and values as the command line switch. The command line switch overrides the modelsim.ini variable.
</li>
<li>
A "Stop" button has been added to the Signal Search dialog box. This button is used to abort a search that may be taking too long.</li>
