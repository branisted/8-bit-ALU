   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.7 Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the 5.7b release. If you are migrating to the 5.7b release from
       5.6x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes for product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7 patch releases. The previous version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
       attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * There was a problem where deleting a wave cursor caused strange
       results on hp700.
     * restart performance was slow for designs with large fanout and few
       or no signals logged.
     * When editing files in the Source window and doing compiles was
       done in combination with invoking the simulator on the associated
       design and/or doing run and step commands, sometimes the Source
       window unexpectedly closed one of the files. Trying to reopen the
       closed file resulted in a Tcl error.
     * Pasting an item using Ctrl-V in the Wave window caused the item to
       be pasted twice.
     * Double-clicking an assertion in the Main window transcript caused
       a locked wave cursor to move if it was the active cursor. Now,
       double-clicking an assertion time will scroll the Wave window to
       display the specified time, but will move the active cursor to the
       specified time only if it is not locked.
     * In the Dataflow window, 'celldefine cells can be mapped to
       built-in symbols. In some cases, the port order is important for
       getting the correct ports attached to the correct pins on the
       symbol. There was a bug where the lexical order of the ports was
       used instead of the declaration order.
     * The 'Design Unit' and 'Design Unit Type' fields in the workspace
       structure pane were not displayed for many region types in
       non-simulation datasets.
     * When two projects were opened, one after another, and both
       projects were created with a previous version of ModelSim, a Tcl
       error resulted when attempting to open the second project.
     * When opening a project that was created with a previous version of
       ModelSim, a dialog box was presented offering to make a backup of
       the project file. Attempting to use the close icon (X box in the
       title bar) to cancel the dialog box incorrectly 'OKed' the dialog
       box, and a backup was created.
     * When sorting items in the structure pane, in some cases items
       disappeared, children were lost or columns had different numbers
       of items.
     * Double-click behavior in the structure pane did not work
       correctly.
     * An add wave command that was given a long name that it could not
       find crashed while trying to display an error message.
     * The Next Zero Hits/Previous Zero Hits Source window toolbar
       buttons for code coverage stopped on excluded lines.
     * The ".structure.tree write" command changed in 5.7 and was not
       writing the same information as in previous releases. This issue
       was resolved such that the write output now contains both the
       instance name and design unit information as in previous releases.
     * The -pagecount option for the write wave command was disabled in a
       prior release. It has been re-enabled.
     * There was a problem with Edit->Find in the Wave, List, and Signals
       windows that caused the '[' character to be ignored in the search.
     * In the Wave window, the grid count in the timeline area wrapped to
       negative numbers.
     * In the Wave window, virtual signals and functions sometimes
       displayed seemingly random values in the wave portion of the
       window, while displaying correct values in the value column.

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * The force and noforce commands didn't work correctly with
       optimized (-fast) cell ports.
     * Non-wildcard references to optimized cell ports in the add command
       are supported without the use of the -optcells argument.
     * Some large designs experienced extremely long load times when the
       -v2k_int_delays switch was used.
     * A hierarchical reference to a multidimensional array element was
       not converted to an implicit net. The result was a simulator error
       during load.
     * The compiler crashed while compiling a continuous assignment
       having a variable indexed vector net on the right-hand side when
       compiled with -fast and if the net on the right-hand side was
       assigned in a continuous assignment having a constant right-hand
       side.
     * Usage of non-zero integer format sizes with $display was ignored.
       Now an illegal format, like "%8b", generates an error message.
     * SDF annotation failed for conditional path delays with expressions
       containing the "===" comparison operator.
     * Verilog generate blocks were not correctly registered in the WLF
       file. This resulted in a crash when opening the WLF file for
       post-simulation viewing.
     * After loading a compressed SDF file ModelSim expected all
       following SDF files to also be compressed. This state is now reset
       for each file.
     * The +alt_path_delays switch had no effect on optimized cells.
     * Bidirectional pass switch primitives behaved incorrectly in some
       cases when the design was compiled with -fast and when terminals
       of the tran primitives were connected to nets that were "shorted"
       to other nets via port shorting or port aliasing modules.
     * A large network of bidirectional pass switches connected to common
       supply0 or supply1 nets performed extremely slowly.
     * In 5.7 an optimization for delayed NBA assignments broke in the
       case where the delay was a variable and the variable was zero
       delay.
     * When an optimized Verilog cell was compiled with -fast and
       instantiated with one or more output ports left unconnected it
       caused the simulator to crash.
     * The compiler crashed when a GENERATE IF or CASE controlled
       instantiation contained a port that was assigned with a literal
       numeric value.
     * Modules instantiated with inherited parameters inside a generate
       loop caused the simulator to crash.
     * On 64-bit platforms, in some cases the compiler generated an
       incorrect error stating that:
       "<name> has already been declared in this scope."
       For this to occur the compiler needed to have processed several
       10s of millions of Verilog identifiers.
     * SDF annotation failed for conditional path delays with expressions
       containing the "===" comparison operator.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * PLI functions that returned strings could not return a string
       longer than 4095 characters because the PLI string buffer is only
       4096 bytes. A resizeable string buffer has been added to handle
       strings longer than 4095 characters. This buffer is overwritten
       every time that it is used.
     * ModelSim crashed if an entry in a veriusertfs table did not
       contain a system task/function name in the tfname field. The new
       behavior is to issue a warning and ignore the entry.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * In some cases a process disappeared or behaved incorrectly if the
       following conditions occurred:
          + The process P had the same sensitivity list as one or more
            other processes.
          + One of the other processes modeled a latch by containing a
            single IF statement with no ELSE or ELSIF clause and the if
            condition was of the form: <signal in sensitivity list> =
            <constant value>
     * Too many drivers were created for a signal assignment to an
       indexed signal where the index depended on a constant whose value
       was an attribute of another constant whose type was an
       unconstrained array and whose size and value was determined by a
       function call.
     * On 32-bit HP and Solaris machines, objects of type time could
       incorrectly have the upper and lower 32 bits swapped when doing
       arithmetic operations.
     * Vector signals declared in packages sometimes incorrectly reported
       multiple driver errors. This occurred when the following
       conditions were true:
          + The vector signal was an array of std_logic.
          + The vector signal was driven multiple times.
          + No individual elements or slices were driven on the signal.
     * A VHDL constant in an architecture declarative region that has as
       its initial value a FUNCTION call, where that FUNCTION itself
       contains another FUNCTION definition in its declarative region,
       caused a crash during elaboration as the top-level function was
       called.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * The vsim option -trace_foreign was not providing trace information
       for the following functions:
       mti_SaveBlock, mti_SaveChar, mti_SaveLong, mti_SaveShort,
       mti_SaveString, mti_RestoreBlock, mti_RestoreChar,
       mti_RestoreLong, mti_RestoreShort, and mti_RestoreString.
     * There was a problem with name lookup where sometimes a relative
       pathname would not be found if the current context was a process.
       This affected the find and examine commands and FLI functions that
       look up names.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * The built-in accelerated form of the PROCEDURE
       VitalMemorySetupHoldCheck, with the RefSignal argument a scalar
       and the CheckEnabled argument an array, erroneously produced the
       run-time error:
       Bad pointer/access type passed to memory subsystem.
     * Certain overload cases of VitalMemoryAddPathDelay either failed to
       become accelerated code or crashed in the accelerated code.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * A multisource interconnect delay from VITAL to Verilog with
       multiple VITAL drivers lower in the hierarchy caused a crash in
       some cases.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.7b
     * In rare cases, the use of $now within a body of a when statement
       would return an incorrect value for the current simulation time.
       The problem was caused by a race condition between executing the
       when command and updating the current simulation time in the left
       footer of the Main window.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7b
     * ER99226 - Allow display control of real numbers.
     * DR284575 - Tcl command no longer works in ModelSim.
     * DR331472 - Back-annotate in the same session compressed and
       non-compressed SDF.
     * DR336128 - Foreign function problem with elab.
     * DR336129 - Difference in simulation behavior where reg is used as
       delay.
     * DR336130 - Dataflow window is not synchronized with the Source
       window.
     * ER336692 - "ifnone" optimzation needs to be added to reduce memory
       usage.

   Known Defects in 5.7b
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Product Changes to 5.7b
     * The To_X01Z function in the VHDL std_logic_1164 package is now
       accelerated by default.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   New Features Added to 5.7b
     * Optimized Verilog cell support for ifnone delay paths.
     * ModelSim now supports the equivalent function of -elab and
       -load_elab options and checkpoint and restore commands for FLI
       foreign subprograms.
     * Profiling now gives more detailed information about certain types
       of "built in" Verilog processes.
     * The user interface did not allow you to set the precision of real
       numbers. The precision command provides this control.
       The command takes an integer argument that determines the number
       of significant digits to be displayed. The integer argument may
       contain an optional trailing '#' which causes values to be
       zero-filled to the right. See examples below:
   Example1:  precision 5
   Sets the precision to 5 significant digits.
   Example2:  precision 8#
   Sets the precision to 8 digits zero-filled.
       NOTE: This command does NOT affect the internal representation of
       real numbers. It affects only the displayed values.
     * Profiling now gives more detailed information about certain types
       of "built in" Verilog processes.
