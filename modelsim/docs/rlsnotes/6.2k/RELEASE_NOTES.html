<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 6.2k</b>
<ul>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
'const ref' type of arguments are not supported in the function/task calls in assertions. For general function/task calls 'const ref' is treated like a 'ref' after issuing a warning.</li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.2k</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>vcd limit &lt;size&gt;</b> command has been changed adding support for a file size limit greater than 2 GBytes.  The size argument now excepts a unit specifier.  The default <size> unit remains as bytes.  An optional suffix of either <b>Kb</b>, <b>Mb</b> or <b>Gb</b> specifies the units in which the size should be interpreted.  For example:<br>
<code> vcd limit 6Gb </code><br>
or <br>
<code> vcd limit 400Mb </code></li>
<li>
The Verilog front-end now preserves block comments defined in the macro body through the macro substitution process.
</li>
