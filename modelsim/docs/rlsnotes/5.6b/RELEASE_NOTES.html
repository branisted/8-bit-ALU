<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
forward from 5.6 Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See
"Regenerating your libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
more information on refreshing your models.

</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
the 5.6b release. If you are migrating to the 5.6b release from
5.4 and earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6x and 5.5x
release notes for product changes and new features introduced
during the 5.6 and 5.5 patch releases. The previous version
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation at
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are
now built on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX
10.20 environment, you must use the hp700_1020 platform
executables.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker using version 5.0 will fail with a message
similar to "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00".
Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
</li>
<li>
There is a signature change in the 5.6b ieee math_real library. If you have
a design which was compiled in 5.6 or 5.6a, which when attempting to load a 
design using 5.6b <b>vsim</b> gets similar error messages to the following:
<p>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.testbench because modeltech/linux/../ieee.math_real has changed.<br>
# Error loading design<br>
</code>

<p>
then you need to recompile your design with 5.6b <b>vcom</b>.

<p>
This change is a result of a bug fix to improve the accuracy of the
representation of floating-point constants. See <a href=#vhdldefects>"VHDL Defects
Repaired in 5.6b"</a>.


</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6b</b>
<ul>
<li>
X-windows resource entries that started with "vsim" or "Vsim" 
(e.g. Vsim*Font:) were not found and used by ModelSim; only general 
patterns (e.g. *Font) were found and used.
</li>
<li>
In ModelSim 5.6, the "'hasX" attribute was implemented. When a multi-bit
signal was used with the <b>searchlog</b> command, ModelSim incorrectly matched
any transitions, not just those containing 'X' (or 'U').

</li>
<li>
There were several update problems with the color-mapped scrollbar in the 
Wave window.
</li>
<li>
The command <b>set PrefMain(geometry) wxh+x+y</b> should reposition and resize
the Main window. This feature stopped working with release 5.5.

</li>
<li>
List window item triggering was always enabled after a restart.
</li>
<li>
Any signals added to the List window while the List window signal triggering
was disabled continued to have triggering disabled when the List window
signal triggering was re-enabled.
</li>
<li>
Parsing of the <b>vsim -view</b> commands did not work correctly when invoked 
from the ModelSim command line prompt.
 

</li>
<li>
An explicitly created virtual signal using slice notation in the
virtual expression sometimes resulted in the new virtual signal 
appearing as a Verilog signal in the GUI.  This had a side
effect where some virtual signals captured to a wave format file
appeared as Verilog signals when the wave file was replayed.

</li>
<li>
Performance improvements were made to the Library browser.
The slow performance affected execution of various commands,
most notably the compilers, vcom and vlog.  However, it was also evident
when selecting between the Library, Project, and sim tabs in the Workspace view.
Two significant changes were made:<br>
<UL>
<LI>
Loading of library design unit information was improved significantly.
<LI>
Updates now occur on a lazy basis instead of after each tab selection or
command execution.  The latter will most readily be seen when performing
multiple compilations from ModelSim. Instead of updating the window after each
compilation, the window will update when "it notices" that something has
changed in the library.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Some VHDL processes did not display the correct connectivity in the Dataflow
window and often missed several input signals. To see the correct connectivity 
in 5.6b it is necessary to recompile or refresh the VHDL architecture.
</li>
<li>
The WLF writer sometimes caused waves to be drawn incompletely. A 
<b>zoom full</b> drew waves over only a subset of the simulation time.  
WLF files with this problem must be regenerated with ModelSim 5.6b to be
corrected.
</li>
<li>
In ModelSim 5.6 and 5.6a, the <b>dir</b> command was redefined for the
C debug feature. This prevented <b>dir</b> from being executed in the
underlying programming shell. Once again, <b>dir</b> shows a directory
listing on the host platform.
</li>
<li>
In OEM versions of ModelSim, attempting to open the Tools menu of the Wave
window would produce an error dialog. ModelSim no longer attempts to enable
items pertaining to waveform comparison, which is not available in OEM 
versions.
</li>
<li>
Wave window "mouse mode" changes in one Wave window, affected other open 
Wave windows. Also, the mouse mode was not communicated to new window panes 
within the same Wave window.
</li>
<li>
When the final simulation time of a log file had a delta iteration greater than
0, it was possible that the waveform compare utility emitted the following
error when reloading a comparison:<br>
<code>
addStreamEvent: stream wave events not monotonic in time and iteration.<br>
</code>
The compare utility now correctly determines the starting delta iteration.
</li>
<li>
Using a file or directory path containing foreign language encoded characters prevented ModelSim from finding the directory or file. This problem occurred in the compile dialog, project dialog, transcript window, workspace area, and in searching for libraries and source files.
</li>
<li>
Waveform comparison sometimes generated extraneous differences at time
zero when doing an asynchronous comparison with non-zero tolerances.
It would compare against an uninitialized or invalid value.
</li>
<li>
When issued inside ModelSim at the ModelSim or VSIM prompt, the <b>vsim</b> 
command should have opened the Simulate dialog box if no arguments were given.
</li>
<li>
If a design with two top level modules was loaded from the Simulate window 
(ModelSim Simulate Menu->Simulate, expand 'work', select the two modules, 
then select the 'Load' button) ModelSim gave an error.


</li>
<li>
The 'Simulation...' startup dialog, VHDL tab, generic list did not have
a scrollbar. A dynamic scrollbar was added as well as column sorting for
each column.
</li>
<li>
Saving waveform compare differences and reloading them failed when
a signal being compared was an array of integers.
</li>
<li>
The following sequences of menu picks in the Main window caused a Tcl
dialog error.<br>
File > Import > Library > Browse<br>
File > New > Project > test1 ...then select... File > Browse<br>
Simulate > Libraries > Add<br> 
The Tcl dialog error was of the following form:<br>
<code>
Title : Error in Tcl script<br>
Error : bad option ".lwiz":must<br>
be -defaultextension, -filetypes,<br> 
initialdir, -initialfile, parent,<br>
or -title<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
The Variables window crashed intermittently during a <b>restart</b> or 
<b>restore</b> operation.
</li>
<li>
ModelSim crashed intermittently when signals were logged and the List window
was open during a <b>restart</b> or <b>restore</b> operation.
</li>
<li>
Creating Wave window panes sometimes produced the following TCL error when a new
pane was created (Insert->Window Pane):<br>
<code>
Error: component "tree3" already defined
</code>
</li>
<li>
Selecting some implicit-wires in the Dataflow window caused a Tcl error.
</li>
<li>
ChaseX and TraceX generated Tcl errors when trying to trace back multiple
inputs.
</li>
<li>
User hook execution failed if the user hook procedure had any additional 
arguments. For example:<br>
<code>
lappend PrefStructure(user_hook) [list myStructProc 0]
</code><br>
In this example, the proc myStructProc takes two arguments, the first 
being the value "0", the second is added by ModelSim and is the window 
pathname. This defect was introduced in release 5.6.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6b</b>
<ul>
<li>
The $init_signal_spy system task string arguments were not allowed
to be expressions that evaluated to strings.
</li>
<li>
The Verilog macro instance parser failed if a macro instance had parameters that
contained strings that were similar to "8'h0f" or had a parameter that was enclosed 
in curly braces ({,}).
</li>
<li>
The vsim <b>-filemap_elab</b> argument did not map $sdf_annotate files loaded 
after time 0.
</li>
<li>
PLI misctf reason calls of reason_endofcompile occurred multiple times when
used in conjunction with the <b>-load_elab</b> option.
</li>
<li>
Some cases of parameters initialized to a complex expression involving
real numbers and other parameters crashed the simulator during elaboration.

</li>
<li>
Changing a value in a Verilog memory with the <b>change</b> command sometimes 
caused a crash.
</li>
<li>
The Verilog compiler encountered an internal error when compiling a design
with <b>-fast</b> or <b>+opt</b> having inlined modules with ports that were 
only read in the condition expression of a wait statement.

</li>
<li>
The number of dimensions of a multidimensional expression was
checked only for LHS expressions.  All expressions are now checked.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when a Verilog statement attempted to invoke a task
within a module that had been instantiated as an array. Verilog now supports
tasks within instance arrays.
</li>
<li>
A condition existed that prevented a delay net delay solution from being found 
for some timing check configurations (Warning: (vsim-3316)). 
</li>
<li>
Under some conditions <b>vsim</b> wasn't reporting problems with delayed input
delay solutions for optimized cells (warning vsim-3316).  The false solution
occurred when a delayed input delay didn't satisfy the positive limit of a
$setuphold or $recrem timing check with a negative limit.
</li>
<li>
An out-of-bounds index or an X-valued index of a multi-dimensional array failed
to return an X value for the expression result. The same failure also occurred
for a single dimension array (memory) if the array element index was combined
with a bit-select or part-select of the memory word.

</li>
<li>
A reference to a registered output occurring between the port declaration
and the corresponding register declaration could result in a reference to
the connected net rather than the register. In some cases, this could cause
erroneous results, or, possibly, an internal compiler error when using the
<b>-fast</b> or <b>+opt</b> options.

</li>
<li>
Some modules contained instances that were inlined as a result of performance 
optimizations. The ports of these instances were not visible and therefore 
were not annotated to.<br>
If such ports are encountered during a simulation then you must recompile the 
modules that are specified in the mti_inlined_mods.txt file (or the transcript 
in case mti_inlined_mods.txt could not be opened for writing) to get the 
corrected behavior.
</li>
<li>
Out of range part selection and assignment behavior of variable arrays 
(including memories), did not match out of range behavior of regular variables.
</li>
<li>
When the Verilog compiler was evaluating parameters with the <b>-fast</b>
invocation switch, expressions involving logical connective operators
(e.g. "&&" or "||") could get evaluated incorrectly.<br>
One manifestation of this is if you used this parameter as the bounds to a
vectored register or net. This manifestation would produce the following 
(incorrect) error:<br>
<code>
ERROR: b.v(20): X's in left bound in range
</code>
</li>
<li>
The delay scale factor specified in the $sdf_annotate() system call was ignored.
</li>

<ul>
<li>
An aggregate could incorrectly have the keyword OPEN as a value.  This
would either crash the compiler or produce unexpected results in simulation.
It is now flagged as an error at compile time.
</li>
<li>
When an aggregate expression was used as an actual in a port map and the
choices of the aggregate were non-locally static the following error
would occur at elaboration time.<br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3477) Incorrect number of subelement associations for port<br>
#   'portname'. Formal has 12 elements, actual has 0 elements. <br>
#    Time: 0 ps  Iteration: 0  Region: /some/region
</code><br>

</li>
<li>
An error is now generated for a port map if a conversion function or
type conversion exists on an actual of a buffer port.
</li>
<li>
For VHDL 93, alias now accepts unconstrained array for subtype indication.
</li>
<li>
On the HP and Sun RISC platforms incorrect machine code could be generated
when doing infix operations between two std_logic_vector, signed, or unsigned
operands.  The incorrect code would result in an error about incorrect
sizes.
</li>
<li>
The accuracy of the representation of floating-point constants has been
improved, or made closer to the POSIX standard. In most cases, the
representation will remain unchanged. However, some numbers, (e.g., 3.15626),
had differed from the POSIX standard in the least significant 52nd and 53rd
bits of the mantissa. Programmers should continue to avoid floating-point
equality tests, using bounded comparisons instead.
</li>
<li>
An array whose element was an array or record that was one byte in size
would not get intialized properly if using OTHERS.

</li>
<li>
When compiling with the -87 switch (or without the -93 switch), the NOW
function was erroneously determined to be globally static for the purpose
of identifying assignments to variables that qualify as initial values. As
a result, statements assigning NOW to a variable at the beginning of a process
gave the variable a constant value. The compiler was changed to ensure that
NOW is not globally static.
</li>
<li>
Configurations with multiple component configurations of the same component
could leave type descriptors of the associated entity's generics and ports
uninitialized. This could result in erroneous bounds and range errors, and
sometimes core dumps, when
accessing generics and ports by the entity. The compiler
erroneously allocated globally static type descriptors in only one of the
component configurations, leaving other globally static type descriptors for
the same component uninitialized. The compiler was changed to allocate
globally static type descriptors in all component configurations.
</li>
<li>
When using the <b>-O5</b> optimization level, mixing array assignments with
indexed array references within a sequence of statements occasionally caused 
incorrect code to be generated. As a result, at simulation-time the simulator 
could have crashed.
</li>
<li>
A crash or incorrect results were produced by VHDL infix expressions which 
required temporary stack space allocation for evaluation. This problem was 
observed with a standard logic vector sum or concatenation expression passed as
an argument to a function or used in a conditional expression subject to 
short-circuit evaluation.
</li>
<li>
When a resolved composite VHDL signal was driven from two places in the same 
process a redundant driver was created for the second assignment. This caused 
the effect of the second assignment to be lost.

due to a problem with how the amount of physical memory was obtained.<br> 
# Allocated space significantly exceeds the machine's physical memory.<br>
# The simulator might start causing excessive paging to disk during a run.





</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when using init_signal_spy with trace_foreign turned on.
</li>
<li>
Under some conditions, optimized cell designs loaded from a checkpoint or

<ul>
<li>
ER 303248 - Added <b>-title</b> switch to <b>view</b> command to set the 
            windows title. See example below:<br>
<b>view -title</b> {My Wave Window} <b>wave</b>

</li>
<li>
ER 295736 - Added Wave window menu item <b>View->Goto Time...</b> and 'g' hotkey.
The Wave window will be positioned such that the specified time is in view.
</li>
<li>
Added support for use of the <b>-quiet</b> switch with <b>-load_elab</b> 
where the quiet mode setting is toggled from its value at <b>-elab</b>.
</li>
<li>
A new <b>drivers</b> feature has been added to the Wave window. The <b>Show 
Drivers</b> operation can be invoked from the tool bar or by double clicking on a
waveform edge.  This operation will open the Dataflow window and display the
drivers of the selected signal in the Wave window.  The Wave pane in the
Dataflow window will also open showing the selected signal with a cursor at the
selected time, and, as always, the Dataflow window will show the signal values
at the current time cursor position.

</li>
<li>
A Verilog design compiled with <b>-fast</b> or optimized with <b>+opt</b> now 
allows instantiation of VHDL components underneath the Verilog. The VHDL design
units must be compiled into a library before optimizing the Verilog design
that references them. The Verilog compiler issues a warning message to
emphasize that the VHDL instantiations are not optimized. For best performance
with <b>-fast</b> and <b>+opt</b>, instantiate Verilog modules when possible.

</li>
<li>
ER 281939 - Cannot restore the color of a signal when modified via
the signal properties. There is now a "Default" button on the color
"browser" that allows setting the color back to its default value (empty).

</li>
<li>
Solaris OS rev 5.9 has implemented a feature to utilize memory
page sizes that are larger than the old default of 8kb.
Vsim has been enhanced to make use of this new feature, which
should help performance of large designs.
(Note this feature only works under Solaris 5.9, with the absolutely
latest Sparc chips.)


</li>
<li>
ER 300042 - Would like an example and explanation for CNNODP message.
</li>
<li>
ER 304854 - PCDPC message is too cryptic.
</li>
<li>
ER 320391 - Documentation for the elaboration file inadequate with FLI.
