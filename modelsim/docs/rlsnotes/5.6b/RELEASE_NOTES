   Key Information
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving
       forward from 5.6 Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the 5.6b release. If you are migrating to the 5.6b release from
       5.4 and earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6x and
       5.5x release notes for product changes and new features introduced
       during the 5.6 and 5.5 patch releases. The previous version
       release notes can be found in your modeltech installation at
       docs/rlsnotes.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are
       now built on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX
       10.20 environment, you must use the hp700_1020 platform
       executables.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only)
       attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual C++ linker using version 5.0 will fail with a message
       similar to "Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00".
       Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * There is a signature change in the 5.6b ieee math_real library. If
       you have a design which was compiled in 5.6 or 5.6a, which when
       attempting to load a design using 5.6b vsim gets similar error
       messages to the following:
       # ** Error: (vsim-13) Recompile work.testbench because
       modeltech/linux/../ieee.math_real has changed.
       # Error loading design
       then you need to recompile your design with 5.6b vcom.
       This change is a result of a bug fix to improve the accuracy of
       the representation of floating-point constants. See [18]"VHDL
       Defects Repaired in 5.6b".
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * X-windows resource entries that started with "vsim" or "Vsim"
       (e.g. Vsim*Font:) were not found and used by ModelSim; only
       general patterns (e.g. *Font) were found and used.
     * In ModelSim 5.6, the "'hasX" attribute was implemented. When a
       multi-bit signal was used with the searchlog command, ModelSim
       incorrectly matched any transitions, not just those containing 'X'
       (or 'U').
     * There were several update problems with the color-mapped scrollbar
       in the Wave window.
     * The command set PrefMain(geometry) wxh+x+y should reposition and
       resize the Main window. This feature stopped working with release
       5.5.
     * List window item triggering was always enabled after a restart.
     * Any signals added to the List window while the List window signal
       triggering was disabled continued to have triggering disabled when
       the List window signal triggering was re-enabled.
     * Parsing of the vsim -view commands did not work correctly when
       invoked from the ModelSim command line prompt.
     * An explicitly created virtual signal using slice notation in the
       virtual expression sometimes resulted in the new virtual signal
       appearing as a Verilog signal in the GUI. This had a side effect
       where some virtual signals captured to a wave format file appeared
       as Verilog signals when the wave file was replayed.
     * Performance improvements were made to the Library browser. The
       slow performance affected execution of various commands, most
       notably the compilers, vcom and vlog. However, it was also evident
       when selecting between the Library, Project, and sim tabs in the
       Workspace view. Two significant changes were made:
          + Loading of library design unit information was improved
            significantly.
          + Updates now occur on a lazy basis instead of after each tab
            selection or command execution. The latter will most readily
            be seen when performing multiple compilations from ModelSim.
            Instead of updating the window after each compilation, the
            window will update when "it notices" that something has
            changed in the library.
     * Some VHDL processes did not display the correct connectivity in
       the Dataflow window and often missed several input signals. To see
       the correct connectivity in 5.6b it is necessary to recompile or
       refresh the VHDL architecture.
     * The WLF writer sometimes caused waves to be drawn incompletely. A
       zoom full drew waves over only a subset of the simulation time.
       WLF files with this problem must be regenerated with ModelSim 5.6b
       to be corrected.
     * In ModelSim 5.6 and 5.6a, the dir command was redefined for the C
       debug feature. This prevented dir from being executed in the
       underlying programming shell. Once again, dir shows a directory
       listing on the host platform.
     * In OEM versions of ModelSim, attempting to open the Tools menu of
       the Wave window would produce an error dialog. ModelSim no longer
       attempts to enable items pertaining to waveform comparison, which
       is not available in OEM versions.
     * Wave window "mouse mode" changes in one Wave window, affected
       other open Wave windows. Also, the mouse mode was not communicated
       to new window panes within the same Wave window.
     * When the final simulation time of a log file had a delta iteration
       greater than 0, it was possible that the waveform compare utility
       emitted the following error when reloading a comparison:
       addStreamEvent: stream wave events not monotonic in time and
       iteration.
       The compare utility now correctly determines the starting delta
       iteration.
     * Using a file or directory path containing foreign language encoded
       characters prevented ModelSim from finding the directory or file.
       This problem occurred in the compile dialog, project dialog,
       transcript window, workspace area, and in searching for libraries
       and source files.
     * Waveform comparison sometimes generated extraneous differences at
       time zero when doing an asynchronous comparison with non-zero
       tolerances. It would compare against an uninitialized or invalid
       value.
     * When issued inside ModelSim at the ModelSim or VSIM prompt, the
       vsim command should have opened the Simulate dialog box if no
       arguments were given.
     * If a design with two top level modules was loaded from the
       Simulate window (ModelSim Simulate Menu->Simulate, expand 'work',
       select the two modules, then select the 'Load' button) ModelSim
       gave an error.
     * The 'Simulation...' startup dialog, VHDL tab, generic list did not
       have a scrollbar. A dynamic scrollbar was added as well as column
       sorting for each column.
     * Saving waveform compare differences and reloading them failed when
       a signal being compared was an array of integers.
     * The following sequences of menu picks in the Main window caused a
       Tcl dialog error.
       File > Import > Library > Browse
       File > New > Project > test1 ...then select... File > Browse
       Simulate > Libraries > Add
       The Tcl dialog error was of the following form:
       Title : Error in Tcl script
       Error : bad option ".lwiz":must
       be -defaultextension, -filetypes,
       initialdir, -initialfile, parent,
       or -title
     * The Variables window crashed intermittently during a restart or
       restore operation.
     * ModelSim crashed intermittently when signals were logged and the
       List window was open during a restart or restore operation.
     * Creating Wave window panes sometimes produced the following TCL
       error when a new pane was created (Insert->Window Pane):
       Error: component "tree3" already defined
     * Selecting some implicit-wires in the Dataflow window caused a Tcl
       error.
     * ChaseX and TraceX generated Tcl errors when trying to trace back
       multiple inputs.
     * User hook execution failed if the user hook procedure had any
       additional arguments. For example:
       lappend PrefStructure(user_hook) [list myStructProc 0]
       In this example, the proc myStructProc takes two arguments, the
       first being the value "0", the second is added by ModelSim and is
       the window pathname. This defect was introduced in release 5.6.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * The $init_signal_spy system task string arguments were not allowed
       to be expressions that evaluated to strings.
     * The Verilog macro instance parser failed if a macro instance had
       parameters that contained strings that were similar to "8'h0f" or
       had a parameter that was enclosed in curly braces ({,}).
     * The vsim -filemap_elab argument did not map $sdf_annotate files
       loaded after time 0.
     * PLI misctf reason calls of reason_endofcompile occurred multiple
       times when used in conjunction with the -load_elab option.
     * Some cases of parameters initialized to a complex expression
       involving real numbers and other parameters crashed the simulator
       during elaboration.
     * Changing a value in a Verilog memory with the change command
       sometimes caused a crash.
     * The Verilog compiler encountered an internal error when compiling
       a design with -fast or +opt having inlined modules with ports that
       were only read in the condition expression of a wait statement.
     * The number of dimensions of a multidimensional expression was
       checked only for LHS expressions. All expressions are now checked.
     * The simulator crashed when a Verilog statement attempted to invoke
       a task within a module that had been instantiated as an array.
       Verilog now supports tasks within instance arrays.
     * A condition existed that prevented a delay net delay solution from
       being found for some timing check configurations (Warning:
       (vsim-3316)).
     * Under some conditions vsim wasn't reporting problems with delayed
       input delay solutions for optimized cells (warning vsim-3316). The
       false solution occurred when a delayed input delay didn't satisfy
       the positive limit of a $setuphold or $recrem timing check with a
       negative limit.
     * An out-of-bounds index or an X-valued index of a multi-dimensional
       array failed to return an X value for the expression result. The
       same failure also occurred for a single dimension array (memory)
       if the array element index was combined with a bit-select or
       part-select of the memory word.
     * A reference to a registered output occurring between the port
       declaration and the corresponding register declaration could
       result in a reference to the connected net rather than the
       register. In some cases, this could cause erroneous results, or,
       possibly, an internal compiler error when using the -fast or +opt
       options.
     * Some modules contained instances that were inlined as a result of
       performance optimizations. The ports of these instances were not
       visible and therefore were not annotated to.
       If such ports are encountered during a simulation then you must
       recompile the modules that are specified in the
       mti_inlined_mods.txt file (or the transcript in case
       mti_inlined_mods.txt could not be opened for writing) to get the
       corrected behavior.
     * Out of range part selection and assignment behavior of variable
       arrays (including memories), did not match out of range behavior
       of regular variables.
     * When the Verilog compiler was evaluating parameters with the -fast
       invocation switch, expressions involving logical connective
       operators (e.g. "&&" or "||") could get evaluated incorrectly.
       One manifestation of this is if you used this parameter as the
       bounds to a vectored register or net. This manifestation would
       produce the following (incorrect) error:
       ERROR: b.v(20): X's in left bound in range
     * The delay scale factor specified in the $sdf_annotate() system
       call was ignored.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.6b
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * An aggregate could incorrectly have the keyword OPEN as a value.
       This would either crash the compiler or produce unexpected results
       in simulation. It is now flagged as an error at compile time.
     * When an aggregate expression was used as an actual in a port map
       and the choices of the aggregate were non-locally static the
       following error would occur at elaboration time.
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3477) Incorrect number of subelement
       associations for port
       # 'portname'. Formal has 12 elements, actual has 0 elements.
       # Time: 0 ps Iteration: 0 Region: /some/region
     * An error is now generated for a port map if a conversion function
       or type conversion exists on an actual of a buffer port.
     * For VHDL 93, alias now accepts unconstrained array for subtype
       indication.
     * On the HP and Sun RISC platforms incorrect machine code could be
       generated when doing infix operations between two
       std_logic_vector, signed, or unsigned operands. The incorrect code
       would result in an error about incorrect sizes.
     * The accuracy of the representation of floating-point constants has
       been improved, or made closer to the POSIX standard. In most
       cases, the representation will remain unchanged. However, some
       numbers, (e.g., 3.15626), had differed from the POSIX standard in
       the least significant 52nd and 53rd bits of the mantissa.
       Programmers should continue to avoid floating-point equality
       tests, using bounded comparisons instead.
     * An array whose element was an array or record that was one byte in
       size would not get intialized properly if using OTHERS.
     * When compiling with the -87 switch (or without the -93 switch),
       the NOW function was erroneously determined to be globally static
       for the purpose of identifying assignments to variables that
       qualify as initial values. As a result, statements assigning NOW
       to a variable at the beginning of a process gave the variable a
       constant value. The compiler was changed to ensure that NOW is not
       globally static.
     * Configurations with multiple component configurations of the same
       component could leave type descriptors of the associated entity's
       generics and ports uninitialized. This could result in erroneous
       bounds and range errors, and sometimes core dumps, when accessing
       generics and ports by the entity. The compiler erroneously
       allocated globally static type descriptors in only one of the
       component configurations, leaving other globally static type
       descriptors for the same component uninitialized. The compiler was
       changed to allocate globally static type descriptors in all
       component configurations.
     * When using the -O5 optimization level, mixing array assignments
       with indexed array references within a sequence of statements
       occasionally caused incorrect code to be generated. As a result,
       at simulation-time the simulator could have crashed.
     * A crash or incorrect results were produced by VHDL infix
       expressions which required temporary stack space allocation for
       evaluation. This problem was observed with a standard logic vector
       sum or concatenation expression passed as an argument to a
       function or used in a conditional expression subject to
       short-circuit evaluation.
     * When a resolved composite VHDL signal was driven from two places
       in the same process a redundant driver was created for the second
       assignment. This caused the effect of the second assignment to be
       lost.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.6b
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * There was a memory allocation problem with optimized gates when
       using the -load_elab switch or checkpoint restore commands
       sequence.
     * The VITAL multi-source INTERCONNECT annotation treated VHDL ports
       as case sensitive.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * A disable statement in a Verilog module instantiated directly
       underneath a VHDL architecture crashed the simulator in some
       cases.
     * vsim crashed when a verilog net was driven by two or more VHDL
       signals and the -v2k_int_delay switch was on.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   General Defects Repaired in 5.6b
     * There was an inconsistency in checking for out of maintenance
       licenses between modeltech based licensing and mgcld based
       licensing.
     * On Linux platforms only, the following message might be
       erroneously displayed due to a problem with how the amount of
       physical memory was obtained.
       # Allocated space significantly exceeds the machine's physical
       memory.
       # The simulator might start causing excessive paging to disk
       during a run.
     * The simulator crashed when using init_signal_spy with
       trace_foreign turned on.
     * Under some conditions, optimized cell designs loaded from a
       checkpoint or elaboration file crashed the simulator.
     * Restoring a checkpoint created from a cold restore session crashed
       the simulator. This problem only happened on Linux.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.6b
     * DR 322923 - An FLI cosimulator integration function returned the
       signal's effective value instead of the driving value of an INOUT
       signal.
     * DR 322927 - Modelsim 5.6a Hangs in co-simulation.
     * DR 322925 - Signal 11 received during simulation.
     * DR 322078 - Error in Tcl script when adding existing file to
       project.
     * DR 322360 - Error:bad option "Select Library"; must be
       -defaultextension, -filetype.
     * DR 322453 - Browse button on Create a New Library dialog gives Tcl
       error.
     * DR 323128 - Tcl error when importing a library.
     * DR 323819 - Error in Tcl script when trying to use option -L in
       Simulate menu.
     * DR 320630 - Wrongly reporting a port width mismatch.
     * DR 320641 - # ** Error: $init_signal_spy - the first two arguments
       must be strings.
     * DR 321023 - Verilog design compiles but crashes on load. Compiling
       with -fast allows load.
     * DR 320603 - ** Fatal: Unexpected signal: 11.
     * DR 323382 - Problem with installation in long file name directory.
     * DR 322080 - The mixed design example in the modeltech tree was not
       working correctly. The project file contained a hard pathname but
       required a relative pathname.
     * DR 321421 - Once set, the -coverage switch was persistent, it
       remained on when the user reloaded the design without the
       -converage switch. Without a coverage license, a license doesn't
       exist error occurred each time a design load was attempted. The
       -coverage switch is now reset each time a design load is
       attempted.
     * DR 323386 - -O5 optimization causes crash.
     * DR 324265 - vsim crashes with code 210.
     * DR 323649 - ** Fatal: (vsim-3420) Array sizes do not match. Left
       is (5 downto 0), right is (.
     * DR 324266 - vsim crashes with code 211.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Known Defects in 5.6b
     * If a variable is declared in a procedure and added to the Wave
       window, it will not display results in the waveform pane. This is
       Mentor DR 305485.
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   Product Changes to 5.6b
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   New Features Added to 5.6b
     * ER 303248 - Added -title switch to view command to set the windows
       title. See example below:
       view -title {My Wave Window} wave
     * ER 295736 - Added Wave window menu item View->Goto Time... and 'g'
       hotkey. The Wave window will be positioned such that the specified
       time is in view.
     * Added support for use of the -quiet switch with -load_elab where
       the quiet mode setting is toggled from its value at -elab.
     * A new drivers feature has been added to the Wave window. The Show
       Drivers operation can be invoked from the tool bar or by double
       clicking on a waveform edge. This operation will open the Dataflow
       window and display the drivers of the selected signal in the Wave
       window. The Wave pane in the Dataflow window will also open
       showing the selected signal with a cursor at the selected time,
       and, as always, the Dataflow window will show the signal values at
       the current time cursor position.
     * A Verilog design compiled with -fast or optimized with +opt now
       allows instantiation of VHDL components underneath the Verilog.
       The VHDL design units must be compiled into a library before
       optimizing the Verilog design that references them. The Verilog
       compiler issues a warning message to emphasize that the VHDL
       instantiations are not optimized. For best performance with -fast
       and +opt, instantiate Verilog modules when possible.
     * ER 281939 - Cannot restore the color of a signal when modified via
       the signal properties. There is now a "Default" button on the
       color "browser" that allows setting the color back to its default
       value (empty).
     * Solaris OS rev 5.9 has implemented a feature to utilize memory
       page sizes that are larger than the old default of 8kb. Vsim has
       been enhanced to make use of this new feature, which should help
       performance of large designs. (Note this feature only works under
       Solaris 5.9, with the absolutely latest Sparc chips.)
     * ER 300042 - Would like an example and explanation for CNNODP
       message.
     * ER 304854 - PCDPC message is too cryptic.
     * ER 320391 - Documentation for the elaboration file inadequate with
       FLI.
     * ER 305982 - Keyword 'shared' not recognized by Source window
       syntax highlighting.
