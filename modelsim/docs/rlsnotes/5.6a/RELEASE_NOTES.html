<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.6 
Betas or 5.5x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your libraries"
in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models.
</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 
5.6a release. If you are migrating to the 5.6a release from 5.4 and
earlier releases, please also consult version 5.6 and 5.5x release notes for 
product changes and new features introduced during the 5.6 and 5.5 
patch releases. 

The previous version release notes can be found in your modeltech 
installation at docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release, the hp700 platform executables are
now built on HP-UX 11.0. If you want to use ModelSim in an HP-UX 10.20
environment, you must use the hp700_1020 platform executables.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only) attempts to link 
in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker using version 
5.0 will fail with a message similar to: 
<p><code>
    Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00 
</code>
<p>
    Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used. 

</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
In some cases, on the rs6000 platform, it was not possible to single-step into
VHDL or Verilog procedures, or set breakpoints at call statements. Due to
improvements in machine code generation, expected patterns for procedure calls
were not respected, and breakpoints could not be inserted. Expected patterns
for procedure calls have been restored.
</li>
<li>
The <b>restart</b> command did not successfully re-log VHDL shared variables
which resulted in unexpected behavior in the Wave and List windows.
</li>
<li>
When command line switches <b>-wlftlim</b> or <b>-wlfslim</b> were used,
or modelsim.ini settings WlfTimeLimit or WlfSizeLimit were used, the
resulting WLF file in some cases was unreadable and caused a simulation
crash.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-size</b> option of the <b>dataset snapshot</b>
 command has been implemented.
</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed if items were deleted (including drag-n-drop)
from the Wave window while waves were actively drawing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a Verilog cell was optimized with an inlined module that contained a
sequential UDP inside of that inlined module, certain state information
was not updated properly after evaluation. This led to erroneous results.

</li>
<li>
The <b>+acc=p</b> compiler option failed to make registered ports visible.

</li>
<li>
Vector nets used in the delayed_data or delayed_ref arguments
of $setuphold sometimes crashed the simulator if the design
was compiled with <b>-fast</b>.

</li>
<li>
Some continuous assignments failed to sign extend the
right-hand side expression.

</li>
<li>
The Verilog system function $value$plusargs was not returning a 0 status when
the specified plus argument was not found on the <b>vsim</b> command line.

</li>
<li>
Compiling with the <b>-fast</b> option resulted in false error messages in
some cases when inlining a module instantiation containing unconnected ports.
</li>
<li>
A non-blocking assignment to a concatenation corrupted the left-most
variable in the concatenation if the right-hand-side of the assignment
was wider than the concatenation.

</li>
<li>
The SDF backannotation of a mixed design ran too slowly due to 
optimized annotation of large fanout nets not working properly.
</li>
<li>
$fread was returning at least 32 bits of data regardless of the target register 
width. $fread now returns only enough data to fill the target register.

</li>
<li>
A multisource interconnect annotation from a source port with no internal 
connections to a destination port with multiple drivers sometimes caused a 
crash.
</li>
<li>
Deterministic timing check conditions (i.e. &&& reset) were incorrectly 
evaluated as non-deterministic (i.e. satisfied with a reset of X).
</li>
<li>
There was a performance problem during design elaboration with
Verilog gate-level libraries.

Specifically, if the gate library was compiled with the <b>-fast</b> option
to vlog, and the netlist that used the library was not, a particularly slow
(and unnecessary) path of code was triggered.

This problem could be significantly exacerbated by running without
the design being local to the current machine.

</li>
<li>
Backannotation of SDF INTERCONNECTs to a continuous assignment
statement input corrupted memory and sometimes crashed the simulator.

</li>
<li>
Applying multiple INTERCONNECT annotations to a port using 
<b>+transport_int_delays</b> always resulted in the shortest delay being 
selected. It now selects the correct delay.
</li>
<li>
Changed delay net delay calculation to insure that the correct data
value is latched on negative setuphold/recrem limit boundaries when
the timing check is satisfied.  For example<br>
<br>
  $setuphold(posedge CLK, D, -2, 50, notify_reg,,, dCLK, dD);<br>
<br>
A D change 2 time units after posedge CLK will cause the
new D value to be latched.
</li>
<li>
Under certain conditions, a path pulse spike on an unspecified path crashed
the simulator.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
An index expression for an array object whose element was of an access type
accessing an incomplete type caused a compiler crash.
</li>
<li>
An implicit signal created by using `delayed in a generate statement caused
a crash.
</li>
<li>
Synthesis checks incorrectly flagged the use of a signal's attributes (i.e. 
range, high, low, left, right, and reverse_range) as reads of that signal.
The checks required that signal to appear in the sensitivity list.
If the signal was not present in the sensitivity list a warning was generated.
</li>
<li>
Given a package P, if the statement <b>use work.all</b> occurred within the package
body of P, the compiler could incorrectly report expressions as ambiguous.
An example of an ambiguous error message is:<br>
<code>
2 subprograms named "deallocate" are valid in this context 
</code>
</li>
<li>
When arrays constructed from record types were initialized with aggregates,
the aggregate values were incorrectly computed by the compiler and stored in
static memory. Since the simulator is free to reorder fields of records,
the compiler's initialization could potentially cause incorrect initial values
to be assigned to the arrays. This problem can be avoided within the source by
specifying associations within aggregates. For example:<br>
<code>
((field1 => X"0123", field2 => X"01"), (X"4567", X"23"));
</code><br>
The compiler was changed so that arrays of records are initialized by the
simulator.

</li>
<li>
The <b>-nocheck</b> switch is available in the PE version of vcom. It disables
the generation of range and index checking code. However, the PE 
version did not include the necessary accompanying switches <b>-noindexcheck</b>
and <b>-norangecheck</b> which selectively disable generation of index checking 
and range checking code (respectively). The PE version of vcom now accepts the 
<b>-noindexcheck</b> and <b>-norangecheck</b> switches.
</li>
<li>
On the HP platform only, when setting a breakpoint on the statement that
is the body of an if statement, sometimes a crash occurred when failing the if 
condition. This occurred only when the if statement involved a compound
expression with short-circuiting in which vectors were being returned by
functions in the if expression. Furthermore, the statement on the body 
of the if expression had to be very trivial.

</li>
<li>
Assigning an aggregate others value to a NULL array could cause a crash.
Example:<br>
<code>
  sig(sig'range) <= (others => '0');
</code><br>
where sig'range is (0 downto 1).


</li>
<li>
Attributes like 'range, 'high, and 'low of constant arrays could be
evaluated incorrectly in globally static names or globally static expressions
if the constants were initialized with the expression ( others => ...).

</li>
<li>
The VHDL compiler incorrectly gave an error when the type specified to
the <b>new</b> operator was a resolved subtype.  It was only an error when a
resolution function was specified within the <b>new</b> operator.
</li>
<li>
The compiler attempts to initialize each variable with its first assignment
when its initial value is not previously used in statements of a design unit.
This transformation was incorrectly performed when initial values were
used in other declarations. For example, in the process below, variable y
was incorrectly assigned 6.
<pre>
p : process is
   x : integer := 3;
   y : integer := x;
begin
   x := 6;
</pre>
The compiler was changed to inspect other declarations before replacing
the initial value of a variable by its first assigned value.
</li>
<li>
On the rs6000 platform, while single-stepping, the simulator would not return
to a reactivated WAIT statement, but would instead proceed to the following
executable statement. This behavior was different from single-stepping on other
platforms.
</li>
<li>
When compiled with <b>-O5</b>, certain array assignments were incorrectly 
optimized. These array assignments occurred in subprograms and had identical 
types for the source and destination arrays. As a result of this error, the 
simulator sometimes crashed.
</li>
<li>
On the rs6000 plarform, in certain cases with large VHDL architectures a 
process variable could not be displayed in the Variables window nor could it 
be sucessfully reported on with the <b>examine</b> command. 

</li>
<li>
If a component instantiation had a port map that contained a type conversion
a bogus error occurred when configuring the component instantiation.
The error message was similar to:<br>
<code>
Deferred constant (null) has not been initialized.<br>
Cannot reference deferred constant (null) before full declaration is elaborated. 
</code>
<br>
This occurred only when the architecture containing the component instantiation
was instantiated multiple times.
</li>
<li>
In certain cases the compiler's optimizer incorrectly transformed statements 
fitting the pattern:<br>
<code>
IF ( a = b ) = false THEN ...
</code>
<br>
This resulted in an unpredictable simulation failure.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
mti_RestoreString() reported a restored byte count mismatch error when
used in uncompressed mode or with the <b>-load_elab</b> switch.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
VitalExtendToFillDelay caused the invalid error,
"Fatal: (vsim-3420) Array sizes do not match",
when a design unit was loaded a second time.
</li>
<li>
The SDF complete message was incorrectly displayed for a design with 
negative setup and hold constraints where no SDF was actually applied.
</li>
<li>
Vital2000 negative constraint processing did not properly
handle vectored generics.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
There were several cases in mixed language designs where the INTERCONNECT 
delays were not correctly back annotated.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.6a</b>
<ul>
<li>
WLF files could generate error messages of the form:<br>
<code>
"WLF Error: Unable to resolve type of signal alias \"%s\" (#%d). Ignoring signal."
</code><br>
This message occurred if the formal and the actual were scalar types but the
direction of the range constraints were different. For example, when one range
was (0 to 10) and the other was (10 downto 0). If a sufficient number of these
error messages were generated, ModelSim crashed.
</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b> command would list generics when <b>-in</b> or <b>-ports</b>
was specified to include only certain kinds of signals.

</li>
<li>
init_signal_spy did not function correctly when a path separator other 
than a "/" or "." was used.
</li>
<li>
Passing arguments to the ModelSim <b>Show</b> command resulted in an error. 
For example, "Show /" produced:<br>
<code>
Error: (vsim-4006) Unexpected argument '/'.
</code> 
</li>
<li>
On the RS6000 platform, LFS64 support of SDF files did not work correctly. 
You can now create and read in SDF files larger than 2 Gig.

</li>
<li>
Loading a Tcl library on the rs6000 and rs64 platforms failed with the 
following error:<code><br>
Error: couldn't load file "testload.sl": readExports: bad magic number</code>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim was not finding the list of possible character encodings.
This prevented the change directory command (cd) from working in the
Japanese version of Windows NT.
</li>
<li>
Starting ModelSim on UNIX systems in the installation directory resulted
in ModelSim using a relative path to required TCL libraries. Using the cd
command to change to a different directory prevented ModelSim from finding
some TCL libraries. This also occurred when vsim was invoked with a relative
path.
</li>
<li>
Updated the video poker TCL example to eliminate 
the usage of the Tix widget in order to be compatible with 5.6.
</li>
<li>
A memory leak occurred when compiling with the workspace area displayed.
</li>
<li>
When executing a <b>vmap</b> command from a do script or at the shell level 
where a warning condition resulted, the warning condition manifested as either 
an error condition or was ignored. On UNIX platforms an error was always 
generated and on Windows platforms the condition was ignored. Now when vmap 
encounters a warning condition it uses the proper severity level and exit 
status on all platforms.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-vcdstim</b> switch's functionality should not have driven Verilog 
outputs.
</li>
<li>
The tail of large blocks of allocated memory was not cleared properly during 
a restart elaboration with a design that had a very large vector port.
</li>

<li>
Added support for use of <b>-l</b> <transcript_file> option of vsim
with <b>-load_elab</b>.
</li>
<li>
The <b>View->Encoding</b> cascading menu has been added. This menu contains a 
list of possible character encodings. Making a selection in this menu is 
equivalent to executing the <b>encoding system newEncoding</b> command from the
ModelSim prompt. The default encoding is iso8859-1. When changed, the setting is
stored in the Windows registry or .modelsim file on UNIX systems and restored
for subsequent invocations of ModelSim. The current encoding is displayed in
the menu with a check mark in Windows and a selected radiobutton on UNIX
systems. The current setting may also be determined by executing the
<b>encoding system</b> command.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-direction</b> option to the <b>vcd dumpports</b> and <b>vcd files</b> 
commands has been augmented to accommodate Verilog ports.
</li>
<li>
A new option, <b>+dumpports+direction</b> has been added to the vsim command
line to modify the format of extended VCD files to contain direction 
information. This applies to ModelSim's vcd commands and to the $dumpports
system task.
