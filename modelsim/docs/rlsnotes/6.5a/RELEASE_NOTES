   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * Adding some VHDL record or Verilog struct objects that contain large
       arrays to the Watch window fails. This has been resolved.
     * The find insource command sometimes produces an internal Tcl error. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * Waveforms were sometimes drawn incorrectly (or not drawn at all) when
       using Expanded Time Deltas Mode or Expanded Time Events Mode if the
       simulation time at the right edge of the Wave window was a time that had
       no events. This has been fixed.
     * When  issuing  a  waveform  compare, where the 'gold' WLF file has
       assertions  that do not exist in the 'test' WLF file, an incorrect
       failure with the following error could occur but now compares correctly.
       Fatal  WLF  Error (2): ../../../src/tkgui/compare.c(2639) Internal
       assertion: testRegion!=NULL
     * The noforce command failed when applied to a net whose name consisted of
       a  Verilog-format extended identifier, where the characters of the
       identifier terminated with a space-character. The command produced an
       error with the message, "No objects found".
     * The project status icon was not updating properly when a file's status
       changed. Operations such as editing a file and saving it should change
       the icon indicator, this issue has been corrected.
     * The time display in the footer of the Wave window does not update and
       display the correct simulation time. This issue has been resolved.
     * When using a location map, the soft path was not correctly expanded if
       choosing the design unit and doing a recompile from the popup menu
       (Library Window Popup Menu > Recompile).
     * Fixed a crash related to waveform comparisons involving SC FIFO under
       certain circumstances.
     * Selecting a memory within the Memory window, and issuing the Export data
       patterns command would work properly the first time. A second attempt to
       issue this command on the same memory would result in an error. The
       issue has been corrected.
     * The preference "testtrackercolumnMap" saved in the .modelsim file to
       preserve the column order for the Verification Management Tracker window
       between sessions. Some operations resulted in the invalid value of "-1"
       being included in the list of column numbers saved for the value of that
       preference. This invalid value in turn caused Tcl errors when using the
       Tracker window in older releases (prior to 6.4). This invalid value,
       "-1", will no longer be saved, in the .modelsim file and will no longer
       cause Tcl errors (in 6.3k and later) if it exists in a .modelsim file.
     * The  following  code coverage data column names are renamed in the
       Structure and Instance coverage windows.
        "Stmt hits" to "Stmts hit"
        "Stmt misses" to "Stmts missed"
        "Branch hits" to "Branches hit"
        "Branch misses" to "Branches missed"
        "Condition hits" to "Conditions hit"
        "Condition misses" to "Conditions missed"
        "Expression hits" to "Expressions hit"
        "Expression misses" to "Expressions missed"
        "Toggle hits" to "Toggles hit"
        "Toggle misses" to "Toggles missed"
        "State hits" to "States hit"
        "State misses" to "States missed"
        "Transition hits" to "Transitions hit"
        "Transition misses" to "Transitions missed"
        "FEC Condition hits" to "FEC Conditions hit"
        "FEC Condition misses" to "FEC Conditions missed"
        "FEC Expression hits" to "FEC Expressions hit"
        "FEC Expression misses" to "FEC Expressions missed"
     * The add list command's bus expression syntax is broken for some cases
       with extended identifiers. This problem has bee resolved.
     * The alias command does not work with compound commands, for example:
    alias myquit "write list list.txt; quit -f"
       This issue has been resolved.
     * The find virtuals command now behaves consistently with other find
       commands such as find signals and find nets.
     * Waveform compare did not work correctly for SystemC enumerations and
       structures.
     * Delayed virtual signal children names would sometimes be missing or
       named "virtuals:". This most often occurred with bits of registers in
       waveform compare.
     * Corrected an error that disabled the -wlfopt option, resulting in slow
       display of long running wave datasets.
     * Corrected errors in the logging of SC FIFOs and arrays. The errors could
       result in crashes or missing signal values.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * When a module contains multiple UDP instances and the different UDP's
       are compiled in different library then for vopt mode vsim sometimes may
       error out with the message:
       **     Error:     (vsim-3033)     top.v(7):    Instantiation    of
       '/test/bug/lib3.ut_udp2(verilog)' failed. The design unit was not found.
       This defect was actually fixed in 6.5.
     * vlog would fail to read a design while issuing the error '... unexpected
       "end of source code"'.
     * Casting a parameter of string type to an integer type would sometimes
       produce a crash or give wrong results. This is now fixed.
     * A continuous assignment having a variable driver delay behaved as if
       there was no delay in some cases if the assignment was from one vector
       net to another of equal width.
     * Under  certain circumstances (a method in a parameterized class, a
       forward typedef), vlog would print an invalid error about a field of a
       struct not being found.
     * Backslash characters would not be properly formatted within string
       literals in the output of vlog's -E option.
     * Verilog attributes placed before a gate instantiation nested within a
       conditional generate would cause a syntax error.
     * If an element of an external reference to an array of interfaces was
       passed  to  an interface-port, the following error occurred during
       elaboration:
       Fatal: (vsim-8229) Can't take value of this object ('ifarr').
     * A non-wire connection to a module port net declared with a "net delay"
       simulated with zero delay in an optimized design if the module instance
       was inlined.
     * An always block triggered by a hierarchical reference (or a structure
       field  select)  failed  to  trigger  in some cases in an optimized
       SystemVerilog design.
     * An illegal assign to void function name when the function is declared as
       extern would cause a segmentation fault. This is now fixed.
     * Defining a typedef for a class specialization in a package scope and
       then defining another typedef for the same specialization in a class
       scope could cause various elaboration time crashes or errors.
     * vopt sometimes failed to find class method names used in a hierarchical
       reference when the same name worked correctly in novopt mode. This error
       occurred  in  designs that contained generate, conditional or loop
       constructs.
     * Instantiating parameterized interfaces using dot star (.*) notation
       might have given wrong results in vopt mode. This has been fixed.
     * In  order  to support SDF annotation of protected Verilog regions,
       $sdf_annotate calls that meet certain conditions are "hoisted" and
       treated  as  if  they were specified on the vsim command line. The
       conditions are that $sdf_annotate is either the first statement in a
       block or every statement preceding it is a built-in systask. (We used to
       allow user-defined systasks too. Now restricted to built-in systasks
       only).
     * Strictly by the SystemVerilog LRM, class extern method prototypes are
       not allowed to have lifetime (automatic/static) designations. Due to
       common use however, the error checking on this has been relaxed to issue
       an LRM compliance warning as the default and to only produce an error
       with the -pedanticerrors switch.
     * Assigning an interface-array formal port to a virtual interface could
       cause a runtime crash.
     * Default generate block names (genblk[n]) in hierarchical references will
       now be treated as an error in vsim in incremental mode.
     * Verilog or SystemVerilog string parameter overrides from the command
       line(-G/-g) can now be specified without double-quoting the string. For
       example: -Gstring_param=Hello.
     * Non-blocking  assignment  to a field of a packed struct might have
       produced error such as:
       ** Error: test.sv(47): Internal
       error:../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(7376).
     * Using  the +initreg=u switch to initialize UDP registers may cause
       incorrect simulation results.
     * NaN  results  from  a divide-by-zero operation in a variable delay
       expression is not detected and properly reported.
     * A non-blocking assignment to an element of a packed struct might have
       produced wrong results. This is now fixed.
     * vlog printed an internal error when a continuous assignment used a
       concatenation of individual bits of an enum variable.
     * vsim  +notimingchecks  may cause incorrect simulation result in an
       optimized sequential cell that models negative timing checks.
     * Simultaneous events did not always violate $hold and $recovery timing
       checks.
     * When  using -mixedansiports, vlog continues to generate a warning.
       Changed  the  handling  (for  -mixed cases ONLY) so the warning is
       suppressible by the user.
     * vlog now allows endtask and endfunction labels to be specified with
       interface names. For example, vlog now accepts the following: "endtask :
       myInterface.myTask".
     * Timing checks disabled with limits set to zero were not being used to
       solve delay net delays required by negative timing check limits.
     * Fixed $system() issues that only existed on Windows.
     * An event control having either a posedge or negedge on a part-select of
       a vector register incorrectly triggered when the edge occurred on bits
       other than the LSB of the part-select.
     * An always block that assigned to a variable with a blocking assignment
       incorrectly re-queued the same always block for execution in some cases
       if the variable also appeared in the sensitivity list of the event
       control. While an always block is running, none of its event controls
       should be considered active.
     * Fixed a crash due to circular dependencies when importing packages.
       Importing a package, B, from within a package, A, that imports package A
       caused a crash.
     * Sometimes,  false error messages stating "Cannot assign to 'const'
       variable 'this'." used to be generated while randomizing a parameterized
       class with inline constraints. These errors are now fixed.
     * $sdf_annotate failed when trying to back-annotate a protected instance.
     * A virtual interface reference inside a -nodebug region resulted in an
       incorrect error claiming the interface element was not found.
     * If a replication operation with a zero replication multiplier appears
       inside a concatenation, it will be considered to be of size zero and
       ignored.
     * The compiler crashed compiling a SystemVerilog package containing a
       packed structure having a mix of 4-state and 2-state element types in
       some cases.
     * The error message given for illegal assignments to class objects now
       includes the name of the library and package where the class types were
       defined, like:
       ** Fatal: Illegal assignment to class type A #(int) [in work.pkg1] from
       class type A #(int) [in work.pkg2]
     * Verilog macros with long macro bodies could cause vlog to crash.
     * A  continuous assignment in an optimized design produced incorrect
       results in some cases where the LHS is a vector net and the RHS is a
       smaller vector.
     * Fixed a memory leak in non-blocking assignments to a struct.
     * When  overriding  an  untyped value parameter with another untyped
       parameter having more than 32-bit value for vopt mode, the overridden
       parameter value may sometimes be truncated to 32-bit.
     * Iterating over an associative array using foreach might have given
       illegal errors. All such errors have been resolved.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * PLI/FLI shared objects that register exit callbacks using g_atexit()
       would sometime crash the simulator during quit. This is fixed now.
     * VPI  VCBs  (value-change  callbacks)  placed  on  objects  of type
       vpiPackedArrayVar were not removed correctly by vpi_remove_cb(). This
       has been fixed.
     * The  vpiScope  and  vpiModule transitions from VPI objects of type
       vpiGenScope are now available.
     * Some issues getting VPI objects that are subcomponents of complex mixed
       unpacked/packed structs using vpi_handle_by_name() have been fixed.
     * The vpi_iterate() transition for objects of type vpiNetArray on objects
       of type vpiGenScope has been implemented.
     * The LRM describes upwards scope traversal transitions vpiModule and
       vpiInstance  in  the  instances  class  diagram,  notes  2  and 3.
       Implementation of these transitions has been completed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * Use of non-existent ports or generics would not be flagged as an error
       in a block's port or generic map.
     * In some cases when VHDL blocks had generic maps with generic dependent
       port  ranges and were used inside generates, a port mismatch error
       occurred. This is now fixed.
     * Some error conditions were not detected when a force command was applied
       to a subelement of a composite port of mode in or inout. Error number
       3456 is now correctly issued in these cases.
     * External names that targeted an alias did not work. If vopt was either
       run explicit or implicitly, the simulator would report the error:
       # ** Error: (vsim-8345) Unable to find original top-level design units
       for optimized design "_opt".
       If vopt is not run, the simulator would report that the target of the
       external name was not found.
     * If a process that models a simple latch had local variables that were
       initialized with expressions that had side-effects, the initialization
       was incorrectly optimized away.
     * Block generics would incorrectly be set to their default values if SDF
       annotation is present in the design.
     * Fixed a crash due to circular use clauses. Using a package, B, from
       within a package, A, that uses package A caused a crash.
     * A signal that is the prefix of certain predefined attribute names (as in
       sig'LENGTH), where only the type of the signal and not its value is
       being accessed, is allowed to be referenced from within a PURE function.
     * Compiler error message for incorrect record fields have been improved to
       include type and expression.
     * Subelement associations to a subprogram's parameter that is of kind
       signal and of a record type, would cause a crash or an incorrect error
       message like:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3420) Array lengths do not match.
     * Functions SHIFT_LEFT, SHIFT_RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, and ROTATE_RIGHT in IEEE
       standard packages numeric_bit and numeric_std did not perform the proper
       bounds checking on the "count" formal, which is of subtype NATURAL,
       allowing negative values to be passed to calls to these functions when
       the accelerated versions of these functions were used. This has been
       fixed to produce the expected out-of-range error when this occurs during
       a running simulation.
     * A severe slowdown in vcom/vopt has been fixed for VHDL designs with a
       large number of if/elsif statements having complex conditions.
     * VHDL  designs instantiated from a SystemC instance could crash the
       simulator. A package containing signals would be incorrectly elaborated
       if the package was reference only by lower level VHDL design units and
       to the design unit directly instantiated from SystemC.
     * Compilation of a VHDL package containing a COMPONENT declaration having
       a port of a subtype that depends on one of the component's generic
       values could sometimes result in an Internal error (at allocate.c(1478))
       when switch -novopt was used. This has been fixed.
     * In certain instances involving configurations vopt cannot find an entity
       in an entity_aspect when multiple logical libraries are mapped into a
       single physical library. This is now fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.5a
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * In VITAL memory models, some HOLD violations were incorrectly reported
       as SETUP violations, and some HOLD violations reported an incorrect
       state (High vs. Low).
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * sccom can now operate on read-only current directories.
     * vsim could hang during a run if Ctrl-C was entered and when the CDebug
       tool had been started.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * vopt gave 'Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(51) loc != NULL'
       in some cases when a module having an assert statement got inlined.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * Using  SignalSpy  to mirror the value of single-bit vectors at the
       SystemVerilog-VHDL boundary, i.e. VHDL std_logic_vector(4 to 4) to
       Verilog reg [0:0], would produce an incorrect type mismatch error. This
       has been fixed.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * HTML coverage reports can now be generated for the simulation dataset.
     * The "View Coverage Details" item of popup menu in the Verification
       Management Tracker window is now disabled (grayed out) when the row
       selected has a type which has no coverage details.
     * Expanding  covergroup  instance  items  in the Cover Groups window
       occasionally resulted in a Tcl error and stack trace like this:
       querycommand error: cmd=Covergroup::UpdateBrowser
       fcoverVar/concat_tester:monitor_channel_data:chanasrc/testconcat.sv4300
       100 results=can't read "tag": no such variable
       This has been fixed.
     * Excluded toggles were included in HTML coverage reports but should not
       have. This has been fixed.
     * The  HTML summary report now shows the count of passing tests with
       warnings separately.
     * Wrong toggle coverage statistics were shown in the Workspace window in
       simulation mode when some bits of a vector are excluded.
     * Wildcard tagging of UCDB testrecords is now permitted.
     * The Missed Coverage window did not show the last "elsif" missed branch
       when the "else" was absent in the branch.
     * Missed expressions were showing as missed conditions in viewcov mode
       when only FEC of the expression was missed.
     * Merging produced an incorrect toggle 0->Z transition count.
     * VHDL process statements were not getting included in statement coverage.
       This was inconsistent with Verilog where we included always statements
       in statement coverage. Now VHDL process statements will appear in code
       coverage.
     * Sometimes  when  compiling a design unit with -cover bcesft, which
       instantiates a design unit compiled with -cover bcesfx, the following
       erroneous error would occur:
       ** Error: (vcom-1913) Ambiguous options bcesfx, toggle and extended
       toggle both specified.
       This has been fixed.
     * There are two different coverage flows:
        The Manual Flow that includes toggle add/disable/enable.
        The Compile/Simulator Flow that includes vsim coverage with coverage
            exclude.
       Fixed a problem when using toggle add command from the first flow and
       then excluding nodes using the coverage exclude command from the second
       flow.
     * Allow wildcard placeholders in UCDB test names that are expanded in
       viewcov mode.
     * Fixed a bug in coverage viewing mode that causes incorrect coverage
       count  for all-false branches to show up in GUI/text reports after
       applying exclusions.
     * vcover report -html ... no longer segmentation faults when given a UCDB
       having a test record with a non-standard TESTSTATUS value.
     * The  "False" count of the "else branch" in VHDL was always zero in
       viewcov mode in the Source window.
     * Scalar toggles are shown with the expandable '+' sign in the Missed
       Toggles window, and the children of vector toggles were not in sorted
       order.
     * FSM  multitrans coverage transitions did not appear in the Details
       window.
     * Headers of FEC/UDP coverage reports would report 'short-circuiting
       enabled' even for expressions/conditions which are not considered for
       short-circuiting. This has been fixed and now the FEC/UDP coverage
       report  headers  for such expressions will correctly report 'short
       circuiting disallowed' instead.
     * Turned  off  code coverage columns by default in Structure window,
       depending on existence of coverage kinds.
     * In the event that a tab in the Missed Coverage window is empty, a status
       message is now added to the tab indicating why the tab is empty.
     * The toggle report's header always has columns for extended toggling even
       if there are no extended toggle nodes in the design. Also, there was a
       spacing problem for integer toggles. The toggle report is now formatted
       according to the types of toggle nodes to be reported and the spacing
       for integer toggles has been corrected.
     * vcover was getting a segmentation fault while generating a HTML report
       on a UCDB file.
     * An 'x' assignment to a FSM state variable with FSM coverage enabled,
       when compiled with the -sv flag would sometimes result in an internal
       error in vlog. This has been fixed.
     * Fixed a bug in FSM recognition to exclude certain invalid patterns.

   General Defects Repaired in 6.5a
     * Using checkpoint/restore with designs that use the built-in OVM library
       crash on restore or restart. This issue has been resolved.
     * In some cases under OVM, transaction streams were mis-named with the
       string    passed    as    the    "stream    kind"   parameter   to
       $create_transaction_stream(). This has been corrected.
     * When using OVM, the simulation would sometimes lock up or crash during
       OVM elaboration. This issue has been resolved.
     * The vmake utility generates combined make rules for Verilog design units
       when the source files are compiled with the same command line arguments.
       In some cases, the vlog command for the combined rule did not list all
       the source files.
     * Batch mode execution of dofiles containing add wave commands could fail
       to be replaced with the equivalent log commands. This has been fixed.
     * When a library containing an optimized "black box" (bbox) design is
       moved to a new location, incorrect "file not found" errors were reported
       when a fatal error occurred.
     * -gen_xml will function normally when the library and/or module files are
       read-only. If the top level directory is write-locked, the -nolock
       switch must be used in conjunction with -gen_xml.
     * Fixed problems with UCDB TESTSTATUS in simulation mode.
     * A Warning is now issued when individual files cannot be found while
       loading a merged UCDB file.
     * Added exclusion information to the XML report.
     * Fixed problems with Generate HTML report and altered it to be more like
       GUI/tracker.
     * Generated HTML report had a missing link. Altered HTML report to be more
       like GUI/tracker.
     * Fixed UCDB coverage save hang.
     * Extended VCD data for output and bidirectional ports would sometimes
       output  data  that matched the previous data for the same port and
       sometimes output a time stamp when no data was printed.
     * vcover report -source test_link.v ... will now follow symbolic links on
       UNIX/Linux systems.
     * -gen_xml now properly reports initial value when for an integer constant
       divide.
     * -gen_xml now properly handles the 'RIGHTOF and 'LEFTOF attributes. All
       values from user libraries are displayed as <lib.package.value>.
     * Issuing the fcover configure command with no cover directives causes a
       silent failure. If the path specified to the command contains no cover
       directives, a misleading assertions error message used to appear. Both
       behaviors are now corrected wth and the following error message:
       Error: (vsim 4018) Objects in paths/specified_path are not of type cover
       directive.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.5a
     * On Windows platform, If Destructor breakpoint on SystemC object is set
       via command "bp -c < function_name >", Debugger sometimes does not stop
       at the breakpoint.
     * On  Windows  platform,  if  breakpoint  is set on a SystemC object
       destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This
       crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which
       will prevent unloading of the shared library.
     * The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
       on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
       not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an add
       wave command, when the working directory was created under an older
       32-bit Linux OS.
       This  is  a  Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
       simulator.
       A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator with
       command line option -wlfnolock.
     * The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable. The unwinder is
       the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program
       execution is at. The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance
       data. This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance
       data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.
     * Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and
       memory  profiling at the same time. Memory profiling requires much
       overhead  process,  and it can skew the results of the performance
       profiling data.
     * On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore"
       feature  occasionally  fails. This is due to the memory allocation
       security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3
       update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these
       Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same
       memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator
       relies  on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are
       advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5
       attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this
       anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion.
     * In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression
       table row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in
       question is not the first table on the line.
     * Support  of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on
       Windows. The corresponding C Debug command cdbg stop_on_quit was also
       disabled on Windows.
     * Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on
       consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.
     * On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs
       during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal,
       and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting
       with proper error status.
     * If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of
       warning:
       # Loading mypackage(body)
       #  Internal  Warning  in process_sub: failed to find local inlined
       subprogram called in pkg
       # (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2
       # Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram
       Then add the -noFunctionInline option to vcom for that package, or
       reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they
       are used.
     * Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules,
       interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
       module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
       code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
       instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.
     * The vpiPorts iteration on vpiEnumNet, vpiIntegerNet, and vpiStructNet
       VPI objects has been disabled as it was incomplete and unsafe to use.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.5a
     * The breakpoint behavior of the -cond option has changed to re-parse
       expressions each time the breakpoint is hit. This allows expressions
       with  local  references to work. Note that because of this change,
       condition expressions referencing items outside the context of the
       breakpoint must use absolute names. This is different from the previous
       behavior where a relative signal name would be resolved at the time the
       bp command was issued, allowing the breakpoint to work even though the
       relative signal name was inappropriate when the breakpoint is hit.
     * Errors involving assignments to enums in vlog, vopt, or vsim are now
       printed using message #8386, which is suppressible.
     * In previous versions of the simulator, a random seed was sometimes
       assigned to processes created for non-blocking-assignments, and this
       could affect random-stability, depending on optimizations that were in
       effect.  In  6.5, this is no longer the case; but it may result in
       different results involving randomization from 6.4x.
     * FSM  recognition  reporting in the coverage FSM flow has been made
       consistent with the FSMDEBUG flow. Both flows will only dump the number
       of FSMs detected by default. The -fsmverbose option can be used to
       display FSM RECOGNITION INFO, if required.
     * The default keyboard shortcuts for the cut/copy/paste operations have
       been  changed  to  match  the  Windows  standard  of Control-X/C/V
       respectively. A new preference setting (Main/PCEditBindingsOnUnix)
       category has been added to control this. Note, any opened text windows
       at the time the preference is changed will not see the change until the
       next time the GUI is started.
     * A new search capability has been added for all windows that previously
       supported use of the Contains toolbar and/or the "Edit > Find..." menu.
       This new "Search Bar" will appear along the bottom edge of the window
       it's being used from. It completely replaces the old Contains toolbar
       and individual Find dialog boxes. For those windows that support both
       filtering and finding, the mode for the Search Bar would need to be set
       accordingly (the last selected mode for the Search Bar is remembered
       between sessions). The various ways of choosing the mode are:
          + use Control+M while the Search Bar has the keyboard focus
          + select the mode from the Search Bar's menu (located on icon at far
            left)
          + click the label text which indicates the current mode
       The current mode of the Search Bar is displayed as a text label to the
       left of the type-in field, as well as by the icon located at the left
       edge of the type-in area. The main benefit of having the filtering
       functionality within the Search Bars is that each window now has its own
       unique type-in field as opposed to having to share the common Contains
       toolbar. The latter could lead to confusion over what is shown in the
       toolbar and the filtered content of the windows. There is also a simple
       history mechanism to allow saving search strings for later use. The
       keyboard shortcuts to support this are:
          + Control+S -- save current search text into history list
          + Control+P -- retrieve previous search text
          + Control+N -- retrieve next search text
     * You must now change the encoding of your character representations with
       the encoding system command, where the syntax is:
              encoding system <encoding_name> To obtain a complete list of
       <encoding_name>  options,  use  the encoding names command with no
       arguments. Previously you could perform this action with the View >
       Encoding menu, which has been removed.
     * The VPI compatibility for this release defaults to the 2009 IEEE 1800
       standard. This introduces, among other things, new VPI types for packed
       arrays of struct nets and struct variables. Normative files vpi_user.h,
       sv_vpi_user.h and vpi_compatibility.h are supplied with the latest known
       standardized contents. Users should however be aware that at the time of
       release the IEEE 1800-2009 was not complete.
     * Event order differences between an optimized and unoptimized design have
       been reduced with this release. Specifically, event propagation through
       Verilog zero-delay continuous assignment and primitive networks has been
       changed such that optimizations involving these networks are much less
       likely to result in behavioral differences. However, note that a design
       depending on the old event ordering may not behave the same with this
       release. Both, the unoptimized and optimized behavior may change, but
       should match each other more closely. Ideally, "races" should be removed
       from the design, but, if desired, the user may revert back to the old
       event ordering by specifying the -noimmedca vsim option or by setting
       the following line in the modelsim.ini file:
       ImmediateContinuousAssign = 0
     * Code coverage information is no longer saved under design units in UCDB
       files. Instead, code coverage data for design units are constructed
       on-the-fly when a UCDB file is opened in IN_MEMORY mode. The information
       is constructed by merging all code coverage data from instances in the
       UCDB into the corresponding design unit. This has two main implications
       for UCDB API users:
         1. Using APIs to create code coverage data under design units is not
            allowed anymore and the API calls will error out.
         2. Opening  UCDB  files in read-streaming mode will not generate
            callbacks under design units since there is no code coverage data
            anymore.
     * The PrefMain(ShowFilePane) preference is now obsolete. The Files pane
       will follow current layout as do all other windows.
     * The view * command is now obsolete. The argument "*" will be ignored
       with no note warning or error. A window name or window name prefix must
       be supplied in order to open or configure any windows.
     * When a non-existent entry of an associative array is read, a default
       value is returned. We now re-initialize that value each time, in case
       the user modified it. The exception is if the user set an explicit
       default value.
       For example:
       integer bar[integer][$]; // Assoc. array of queues.
       task execute();
       // Below, bar[2] doesn't exist, so we return the default value,
       // an empty queue. The user is pushing 777 onto it.
       bar[2].push_back(777);
       // Referencing bar[2] again now returns an empty queue. In previous
       // versions, we returned {777}. The $display now prints 'x'.
       $display ("bar [2][0] = %0d", bar[2][0]);
     * Some  changes  have  been  made  to  toggle coverage specific vsim
       command-line options.
          + The  -togglevlogints option has been removed as SystemVerilog
            integer types are now supported for toggle coverage by default.
          + The following vsim command-line options have been changed as they
            were inconsistent with our convention.
               o -togglenoints CHANGED TO -notoggleints
               o -togglenovlogints CHANGED TO -notogglevlogints
     * We now treat a slice of a string as a string. This seems obvious, but it
       is not described anywhere in the LRM. The following is now supported:
              string line = "Hello there";
              string targ;
              initial targ = line[0:5];
     * The option -fsmdebug has been deprecated. A new letter code 'f' has been
       added to +acc to enable FSM detection and debugging. This also makes it
       possible to have module and instance bases selection with FSM debug.
       +acc without any letter code with automatically enable +acc=f.
     * Conditional timing check expressions are displayed as they appear in the
       HDL description. In the past equivalent conditions were displayed. For
       example:
       &&& (cond === 0)
       was displayed as
       &&& (~cond)
     * In some cases the -vmake flag will be required to correctly capture
       Verilog source file dependencies.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.5a
     * Added limited support for export function debugging of outoftheblue
       DPI-C call. One can set breakpoints in or step through export function
       during the execution of outoftheblue DPI-C call. However, this support
       is only limited in the outoftheblue DPI-C calls that are initiated from
       inside a SystemC thread or a SystemC method:
          + To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated
            from inside a SystemC thread, vsim switch -dpioutoftheblue 2 is
            needed.
          + To turn on the debugging support of outoftheblue DPI call initiated
            from inside a SystemC method, Both vsim switch -scdpidebug and
            -dpioutoftheblue 2 are needed.
       For any other kinds of outoftheblue DPI-C calls, no debugging support is
       available.
     * The error for mixing continuous and procedural assignments to elements
       of a vector or packed variable is now suppressible. This is the error
       message:
       ** Error: (vlog-3838) bug15253.sv(56): Variable 'bsu_csr_pdatM3nnH'
       written by continuous and procedural assignments. See bug15253.sv(44).
       This error message can be avoided by using the command: vlog -suppress
       3838 bug15253.sv. This also applies to vsim.
     * Transaction streams may be created with a full or relative path name. If
       the path leads to an existing region, the stream will be created in that
       region. The GUI icon for the stream depends on the region in which the
       stream appears. (MVC streams do not follow this convention, having their
       own icons.) To match a relative path, the tool may search upward from
       the calling region. This change applies to streams created in SystemC,
       Verilog or System Verilog. For example,
       "$create_transaction_stream(".top.dut.stream") will create a stream
       called "stream" in the region ".top.dut" if that region exists.
     * Designs   can   now   record   strings   with   transactions.   In
       Verilog/SystemVerilog, $add_attribute() has been enhanced so it can
       record an SystemVerilog 'string' type. Strings written to regs will
       still be recorded as regs. In SystemC,
       scv_tr_handle::record_attribute(), and other methods, have been enhanced
       to support 'std::string'. Arrays of characters are still recorded as
       arrays and pointer to char is still a pointer.
     * Added the -dpiforceheader switch to vlog/vopt/vsim commands to force
       generate DPI header even when it is empty of function prototypes.
     * The XML report [commands: coverage report -xml and vcover report -xml]
       was not showing test attributes in the case where the -testattr argument
       was passed.
       Now the report is showing them surrounded by the XML tags <test></test>
       for each test.
     * The vl_logic type is now supported in Value Change Dump (VCD) Files.
     * This feature actually has been added to the 6.5 release. Attributes in
       the Tracker window can be modified directly on the column cells. Just
       double click on the cell and the entry field will appear for editing.
       The user is responsible for saving the changes. When quiting the tool
       without saving changes, a confirming dialog will show to remind the
       user.
     * Recursive logging of class types is now supported with the log -r -class
       <classtype>. This command will log all objects of <classtype> which come
       into existence after the command is invoked as well as recursively all
       types of properties of that <classtype> that are also classes. Use with
       caution as this could result in a large amount of logged data.
     * sccom invokes gcc/g++ based on the source file-extension.
          + g++ on source files with C++ extensions - ".CPP", ".cpp", ".C",
            ".c++", ".cc", ".cp", ".cxx and ".ii"
          + gcc on source files with C source extensions - ".c" and ".i"
       Files with interchanged file-extensions and source contents should be
       compiled with "-x c" or "-x c++" gcc/g++ option.
