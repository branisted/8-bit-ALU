   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DIP using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.0x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only when read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions. The OS support is slightly different than the
       simulation environments OS support for designs without SystemC content.
       Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (simulation environment
            version 5.8b and greater)
          + Solaris 2,6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, gcc 3.3
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (Simulation environment versions 6.0
            and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.1f
     * Radix binary waveforms for integer signals were displayed incorrectly.
     * The toolbar icons were not updated appropriately after selections in the
       Wave window.
     * The automatic saving of virtuals during quit could hang the GUI if the
       virtuals.do file (or the file specified by the preference setting Main
       DefaultVirtualFileName) is not writeable.
     * The behavior of drag and drop into a Dataflow window formerly caused the
       display update operation to be done immediately, effectively locking the
       user interface until the operation was complete. Now the drop operation
       causes an add dataflow command to be executed; this command will be seen
       in the Transcript pane.
     * Display names of signals within a group could not be edited.
     * The simulator crashed when using the virtual delete command with a
       wildcard pattern and there was a match with non-virtual items.
     * The Wave Mouse Mode toolbar did not update correctly when the Wave
       window was undocked.
     * WLF file data was displayed incorrectly for Verilog multi-dimentional
       bit arrays of the form: "bit [K:0] L0 [P]".
     * If you link a PSL file to HDL code from a project tab and the path name
       to the PSL file has a space, the operation failed.
     * The "compile to" field (and other sccom compiler options) for SystemC
       objects in the project manager were ignored.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.1f
     * In some cases vopt generated an internal error for assignment statements
       using the SystemVerilog "iff" qualifier like:
       wdata <= @(posedge clk iff ready) 1'b1;
       These errors only occured if the variable being assigned to was unused
       in the design.
     * In some cases SystemVerilog code with multiple packages generated an
       internal error like:
       Internal         error:         ../../../src/vlog/vallocate.c(607)
       vl_current_nesting_level <= save_current_nesting_level
     * Using iff could cause a crash.
     * X-generation due to $width or $period timing check violations in certain
       cases caused an optimized cell instance to produce incorrect result on
       next active clock.
     * In some cases, a vopt optimization incorrectly removed an "initial" or
       "always" construct that wrote to a variable that was also read inside a
       called task or function.
     * In some cases, always_comb and always_latch blocks produced incorrect
       results during initialization. A common symptom was that $monitor()
       displayed  multiple  values  for  the  outputs  of always_comb and
       always_latch blocks at time zero.
     * Function calls, from Verilog HDL, to
       $enable_signal_spy()/$disable_signal_spy() were not accepted when the
       3rd argument was specified.
     * When the tcheck_status command was used with the vsim command line
       option +delayed_timing_checks a segmentation violation occurred in some
       cases.
     * If an argument was given to vlog -dpiheader with a path delimiter in it
       (e.g. vlog -dpiheader path/to/header.h), the generated header file would
       contain illegal C syntax.
     * In certain cases the simulator produced incorrect values for nets in
       SystemVerilog designs when the Verilog "force" was used with a constant
       value.
     * Designs containing generate case statements with nested procedural
       blocks  containing case statements encountered fatal errors during
       elaboration in certain cases.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.1f
     * The simuluator crashed if a vector port of an entity was contrained by
       an attribute on a generic and the entity was directly instantiated.
     * A  VHDL procedure which contains local array variables and calls a
       foreign subprogram crashed the simulator on rs6000 and rs64 platforms.
     * Using the predefined attributes 'INSTANCE_NAME and/or 'PATH_NAME in a
       concatenation  expression  in  some  situations  produce incorrect
       concatenation results.
     * A variable assignment statement in a subprogram where both the target
       and right hand side were of an unconstrained array type would sometimes
       not detect array matching element test failures, possibly corrupting
       memory.
     * An error will now be reported if vcom -genxml entity is executed and the
       entity has not been compiled into the library.
     * A PORT MAP with an association element with a conversion function or
       type conversion (on either the formal part or actual part or both) could
       sometimes affect another unrelated PORT MAP for a component instance at
       a lower level, which would then attempt to perform the conversion for
       itself, causing spurious errors when the conversion failed.
     * Repeated calls to file_open resulted in a memory leak if the file did
       not exist and if file_close was not called before the next file_open
       call.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.1f
     * The kernel crashed on Solaris when the user logged variables of type
       "short" or "unsigned short" within a SystemC module.
     * sccom  incorrectly errored out while parsing gcc options that took
       filenames as arguments.
     * sc_fifo and tlm_fifo of classes defined in the C++ Standard Template
       Library caused the waveform viewer to crash in certain cases.
     * The "View Declaration" and "View Instantiation" menu items were not
       working properly at a C Debug breakpoint.
     * Improved performance of mixed-language vector ports in a Verilog or VHDL
       design instantiating a SystemC module.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.1f
     * Taking a slice wider than 32-bits of a memory could generate incorrect
       results.
     * The -elab_load option caused the following fatal error in the simulator
       startup script:
       can't read "Startup(-dpiexportobj)": no such variable
     * Dataflow operations on wide bus signals in large designs could be very
       slow.
     * It was not possible to View Source for signal names in the Profile
       report  windows.  Also,  specifying Showcalls and Expand All for a
       Structural Profile report window, containing signal names, exhausted GUI
       memory.  Now,  signal  names  in  profile  reports are of the form
       @signal@/x/y.
     * Certain readers commands and dataflow operations on signals with high
       fanout took a long time to complete.
     * The "View Declaration" and "View Instantiation" menu items were not
       working properly at a C Debug breakpoint.
     * Turning on expression coverage caused a simulation difference in certain
       cases. This was related to assignment statements of more than one bit
       wide.
     * The  default value of IterationLimit has been made consistent. Its
       default value is 5000.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.1f
     * dts0100320318 - Wave view in radix binary of a VHDL variable is wrongly
       converted.
     * dts0100326503 - Issue in group signals.
     * dts0100329112 - Wave window GUI display issue with unpacked array.
     * dts0100329342 - Link a psl file to a hdl code from a project tab.
     * dts0100309490 - Simulator crash in fork join block on a conditional
       statement.
     * dts0100329393 - vsim crash with +delayed_timing_checks turned on.
     * dts0100322134 - Unconstrained std_logic_vector causes crash.
     * dts0100330744 - sccom reports a problem with C/C++ file extensions on
       repeated invocations following a good invocation.
     * dts0100327862 - Crash during log of SystemC variables of type unsigned
       short.
     * dts0100326396 - Dataflow window hangs with extremely large fanout.
     * dts0100325412 - vopt generate issue.
     * dts0100321077 - Crash when using the -hexadecimal switch with 'add
       wave'.
     * dts0100308327 - Simulator crashes during design load.

   Known Defects in 6.1f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 6.1f
     * Increase timing check capacities for optimized Verilog cells.
     * Progress information is now included for loading the Dataflow window and
       is now displayed in the Dataflow window's footer.
     * The coverage report and vcover report commands have been changed in how
       toggles are handled. Formerly, if the -cover t compile option was used
       for module A, and module A had a signal connected to module B, then
       toggles would also be reported for module B. Now, if a module is not
       compiled with the toggles option, toggles will not be reported for that
       module, even if it has signals connected to toggle nodes.
     * The Active Processes window now loads only those processes it needs for
       display. This provides better interactive performance on designs with a
       large number of active processes when selecting a process from the
       Structure or Dataflow window.
     * The coverage data files produced by the coverage save command have been
       evolving. Originally toggle coverage data was in one global list; then
       toggles were added to individual instances. But the global list was
       still saved. Now there is no need for the global list and considerable
       space and time can be saved by not saving it. A -noglobals option has
       been added to the coverage save command, which will eliminate saving of
       the global list. Also, if you already have data files containing global
       toggles,  you can use the vcover merge -noglobals or vcover report
       -noglobals option to quickly skip the global list.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.1f
     * vcover merge has a new option -du duname [-recursive]. Use this option
       to merge all the instances of design unit duname from all the input
       files. With the -recursive option it will merge the design subtree all
       the way down; otherwise it merges just one level. The output will be one
       instance of the design unit, containing all the merged data (actually a
