<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>64-bit ModelSim is supported on the AMD64 and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The ModelSim profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. 32-bit ModelSim for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.8x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the ModelSim User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 6.0c
release. If you are migrating to the 6.0c release from 6.0x, 5.8x or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x and 5.8x release notes for product changes and new features introduced during the 6.0x and 5.8x releases. The previous version release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.8 release, FLEXlm licensing software is upgraded to version 8.2. For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 8.2.  The vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2.  If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.  If you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z), but will support the GNU zip format (.gz).  Therefore, ModelSim will read in compressed SDF files that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).  ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
ModelSim's SystemC support has dependencies on both operating system version and C++ compiler version.  The OS support is slightly different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without SystemC content. Also, 64-bit compilation is not supported for SystemC designs.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
ModelSim LE does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches -87, -93, or -2002, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
If a file macro file (.do or .tcl) in a project contained a space in it's name, executing the macro file from the project failed.
</li>
<li>
The preference setting PrefSource(OpenOnBreak) feature was not functioning correctly. Also changed is the behavior that caused source files to be opened automatically when selecting a process in the Structure or Active Process windows.  The source file will only opens when double-click, or if View Declaration is selected from the popup menu. The OpenOnBreak preference controls the opening of the source file when a breakpoint is hit during simulation.
</li>
<li>
Modelsim hung while doing wave compare when code coverage was turned on.</li>
<li>
The <b>wave zoomrange</b> command issued an error message when invoked with no arguments.  It now returns the current Wave window zoom range.</li>
<li>
Modelsim displayed the same enum indices for two different types that use enumeration types and have the same number of elements.</li>
<li>
The 'Force' option in the Objects window popup menu did not work correctly on generics, constants, and parameters displayed in the window.  A 'Change' option was added to the menu which can be used on these object kinds.</li>
<li>
"Functional Coverage" and "Assertion" menus under View -> Debug Windows are disabled for PE.</li>
<li>
The WaveBalloonPopUp could generate a Tcl error dialog when viewing a waveform dataset.</li>
<li>
The GUI icon popup text was not always visible.</li>
<li>
A spurious hierarchy name was added to a register when it was drag and dropped from the Workspace Instance window to the Wave window.</li>
<li>
The C Debug tool init_mode did not work on win32.</li>
<li>
Support for the vgencomp command was added to the PE version of ModelSim.</li>
<li>
Running vsim in command line mode on windows and using CTRL-C to interrupt the simulator resulted in some of the characters typed at the VSIM prompt being sent to the shell and not to vsim. The characters that did go to vsim were not displayed properly.</li>
<li>
Verilog configurations that were instantiated by a VHDL configuration did not work correctly in the GUI structure window. </li>
<li>
Undocked window panes that have been closed do not stay closed on the next invocation of ModelSim.
</li>
<li>
A Tcl error occurred when undocking the Wave window after opening the Dataflow window. </li>
<li>
ModelSim crashed if the first window encountered during invocation was undocked. Typically this is the Workspace window, but it is not necessarily limited to this window.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-wlfnoopt</b> switch now disables the WLF viewer from considering WLF optimizations when viewing a WLF file. Before this release the <b>-wlfnoopt</b> switch only affected the writing of the WLF file--the WLF viewer always used optimization data if present in the WLF file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Attempting to log SystemVerilog class instance variables (e.g., "add log -r /*") caused vsim to crash. Logging of class variables has been disabled.</li>
<li>
Clock event suppression optimizations suppressed valid clock activity in some rare cases.</li>
<li>
Verilog configurations that were instantiated as generated instances or an array of instances did not load correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
DPI calls from C code to automatic SystemVerilog functions received a garbage return value.</li>
<li>
The acc_next_driver routine failed to return any of the bidirectional pass switch "tran" primitives. The vpi_iterate routine also had the same problem when iterating over vpiDriver types.</li>
<li>
DPI calls from C code to automatic SystemVerilog functions would not set up the function arguments correctly (the SystemVerilog functions received a garbage value).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Shift operations whose RHS was an integer sometimes crashed the simulator. This  occurred if the expression was evaluated when the RHS was uninitialized.
</li>
<li>
Type conversion expression syntax requires that the target type be specified as a type_mark. If the target type was a subtype_indication, a warning message was not issued.</li>
<li>
An actual that is an expression may be associated with a formal port only if the mode of the port is IN. The previous behavior was that vcom accepted it, and
the expression was unused (for mode OUT), or had some unpredictable behavior (for modes other than IN and OUT). This is now a warning and becomes an error if the vcom <b>-pedanticerrors</b> switch is used.</li>
<li>
The implicit "=" and "/=" operators for array types return false and true respectively if the operands are of different lengths.  If this situation is detected by vcom, then a warning message is produced.  In prior releases, this warning message was produced only if the <b>-lint</b> switch was present.  Now, this message is produced unconditionally.</li>
<li>
On 64-bit platforms, records containing access types had only 32 bits of the access type initialized to 0s. In most, but not all cases the other 32 bits were also 0s.

</li>
<li>
A class SIGNAL formal parameter is not allowed as the prefix of an attribute name
whose designator is one of the predefined attribute names DELAYED STABLE QUIET
TRANSACTION.  The compiler inadvertently allowed an alias to such a formal parameter to be used, causing unpredictable results in the simulator.  Such an alias in this situation now causes a compiler error.</li>

<li>
sccom produced an error when a variable length array was used.</li>
<li>
sccom produced an error on a member function pointer with default arguments.</li>
<li>
The rising_edge() VHDL function was not working for ports connected to SystemC.  The last_value of VHDL ports were not getting updated while propagating value from SystemC to VHDL.</li>
<li>
scgenmod can now handle VHDL ports the sizes of which are declared in terms of locally static expressions.</li>

The PSL Fusion(:) operator incorrectly matched in the case where an operand of fusion was compared to an empty path.</li>
<li>
Operand of non-consecutive repeat and goto repeat can only be boolean. This was not enforced in earlier versions.</li>
<li>
vcom produced an error while resolving argument of PSL builtin countones/onehot/onehot0/isunknown as PSL bit-vector if the argument was a VHDL concatenation or a VHDL function call with PSL bit-vector return type.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed when a non-consc/next-event repeat is one of the members of SERE 'and' or SERE 'intersect'.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Reading a code coverage exclusion file sometimes failed if at least one
<b>coverage report</b> command was not done first.</li>
<li>
Condition coverage and branch coverage were not working correctly for VHDL
conditional signal assignment or selected signal assignment
statements.</li>
<li>
<b>vcover merge</b> sometimes gave incorrect results when the data being merged came from VHDL packages.
</li>
<li>
There was a problems with negative VCD indices and illegal scope types names in vcd2wlf.</li>
<li>
In certain cases init_signal_spy incorrectly generated length mismatch errors when one of the objects involved is a slice and the other object is not a slice and has no indices specified.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage reload</b> command caused a spurious warning to appear about failing to find a statement when there were multiple statements on the same line.</li>
<li>
The preference variable PrefCoverage(pref_InitFilterFrom) did not work properly in gui mode.  When the variable is to the path of an exclusion file, that file should be loaded automatically when coverage is enable.  The variable now functions properly, in both batch and GUI mode.  </li>
<li>
When using the memory viewer to initialize memory contents, the filling of memories with random pattern data for memories with word widths greater than 31 bits in certain cases resulted in only zeros values being set.  This has now been partially corrected to ensure that the lowest 32 bits of any word will always contain random data; however, any higher bits in the word (over 32) will still not get set to random values.  This 32-bit limitation will be corrected in a future release.</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage on large vectors (32,768 or more bits) resulted in a simulator crash.</li>
<li>
The default Run Length was incorrectly scaled by 1 time unit (x1000) after each invocation when there is a difference in time units between resolution and UserTimeUnit. When using a project, the modified value was saved causing the default Run Length to reach the largest time value (millions of seconds).</li>
<li>
The <b>vcover</b> utility did not properly account for instance specific
exclusions or truth table row exclusions or branch exclusions. It also gave
incorrect results for some incremental statistics. <b>vcover</b> now supports two new options, <b>-bydu</b> and <b>-du &lt;name&gt;</b>, which support reporting by design unit or for a specific design unit. <b>vcover</b> does not yet support design unit toggle data.</li>

If you do a <b>toggle add</b> command on a group of signals and then try to
convert those toggles to extended mode by doing <b>toggle add -full</b> on
the same signals, nothing will change. The only way to change the internal
toggle triggers from 2-edge to 6-edge is to restart vsim and start with the
right command.</li>
<li>
Verilog configurations that are loaded by Verilog generates do not work correctly in the vopt flow.
</li>
<li>
<b>vsim</b> will crash with corrupted memory if branch code coverage is on
and a verilog case statement has a case alternative that is not a constant,
such as a parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
When using code coverage, statement coverage is no longer on by default. To turn
it on you must compile with the <b>-cover s</b> switch.</li>
<li>
When using code coverage, IF/ELSIF/ELSE/CASE statements are no longer counted
in statement coverage; they are handled in the branch statistics and reports.</li>
<li>
Code coverage UDP tables for condition and expression coverage are now able to
do a better job of recognizing common subexpressions. Also, the columns for 
subexpressions was eliminated.</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage data is now written by the <b>coverage report</b> command in 
"by-instance" and "by-design-unit" modes. The data is reported now by the
local name or port name, rather than by the connected signal. In "by-design-unit"
mode, the toggle data is the sum of all the instances of that design unit. 
Normally, only signals that are deemed to be not toggled are written out,
unless the new <b>-all</b> option is supplied to the <b>coverage report</b>
command.</li>
<li>
The memory profiler will no longer unwind the callstack and collect call tree information by default. Callstack collection is turned on from the command line by adding <B>+call</B> to the <B>-memprof</B> option; <B>-memprof+call</B>. At the modelsim prompt the command <B>profile option collect_calltrees on</B> will turn on callstack collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.0c</b>
<ul>
<li>
A <b>-do</b> option has been added to the <b>coverage report -excluded</b>
command that specifies a "do" file format using the <b>coverage exclude
-add</b> commands. </li>
<li>
The <b>coverage exclude -add</b> command is now able to accept multiple line
number and range fields. </li>
<li>
A new preference option, <FONT FACE="monospace"><B>PrefMain(ShowFilePane)</B></font>, has been added that  disables the Files tab in the Workspace window.  This option is useful when a design has a large number of files. Disabling the tab will speed up invocation time of the U/I.  By default, the Files tab is enabled.  Valid values for this preference are <FONT FACE="monospace"><B>1</B></FONT> (<I>enabled</I>) and <FONT FACE="monospace"><B>0</B></FONT> (<I>disabled</I>).</li>
<li>
Increased performance of the delay net delay solver for situations where no solution found messages are generated.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage report</b> command has a new mode: in addition to "by-file" and
"by-instance", it now has a "by-design-unit" mode. In this mode, data is reported
for each entity/architecture or module, with statistics being summed for all
instances of the design unit. Toggle data is summed also, and is reported by
port or local name in the design unit, rather than by the connected signal.
The "by-design-unit" mode can be turned on by the <b>-bydu</b> option, or
can be made the default by the command <b>coverage report -setdefault bydu</b>.
To get a report on a specific design unit, use the command <b>coverage report -du &lt;du_name&gt;...</b> where &lt;du_name&gt; can be of the form library.primary(secondary), in which library and secondary are optional.</li>
<li>
The <b>coverage report</b> command now allows you to set the default mode to
