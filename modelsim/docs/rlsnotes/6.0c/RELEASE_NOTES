   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The  following  platform  changes  are  effective  as  of  the 6.0
       release.
          + 64-bit  ModelSim  is  supported  on  the AMD64 and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise  Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform.
            The  ModelSim  profiling  feature  is not supported in 64-bit
            mode.  32-bit  ModelSim  for  the  linux platform may also be
            installed and used concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.8x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating
       your  design  libraries"  in  the  ModelSim User's Manual for more
       information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  6.0c  release.  If you are migrating to the 6.0c release from
       6.0x,  5.8x  or earlier releases, please also consult version 6.0x
       and  5.8x  release  notes  for  product  changes  and new features
       introduced during the 6.0x and 5.8x releases. The previous version
       release   notes  can  be  found  in  your  modeltech  installation
       directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and  greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim version
            5.8b and greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45
          + Win32  XP  and  2000,  gcc  3.2.3  (ModelSim versions 6.0 and
            greater)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features:  the  first  is by using the -sv command line option and
       the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The  support  includes  EM64T  machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or
       RedHat  Enterprise  Linux  3  Update  3 OS and the following linux
       configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported
       on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * If  a file macro file (.do or .tcl) in a project contained a space
       in it's name, executing the macro file from the project failed.
     * The  preference  setting  PrefSource(OpenOnBreak)  feature was not
       functioning  correctly.  Also  changed is the behavior that caused
       source  files  to be opened automatically when selecting a process
       in  the  Structure or Active Process windows. The source file will
       only  opens  when double-click, or if View Declaration is selected
       from  the  popup  menu.  The  OpenOnBreak  preference controls the
       opening  of  the  source  file  when  a  breakpoint  is hit during
       simulation.
     * Modelsim  hung  while  doing  wave  compare when code coverage was
       turned on.
     * The  wave  zoomrange  command issued an error message when invoked
       with  no  arguments.  It  now returns the current Wave window zoom
       range.
     * Modelsim  displayed  the same enum indices for two different types
       that use enumeration types and have the same number of elements.
     * The  'Force'  option in the Objects window popup menu did not work
       correctly  on generics, constants, and parameters displayed in the
       window.  A 'Change' option was added to the menu which can be used
       on these object kinds.
     * "Functional  Coverage"  and  "Assertion" menus under View -> Debug
       Windows are disabled for PE.
     * The  WaveBalloonPopUp  could  generate  a  Tcl  error  dialog when
       viewing a waveform dataset.
     * The GUI icon popup text was not always visible.
     * A spurious hierarchy name was added to a register when it was drag
       and dropped from the Workspace Instance window to the Wave window.
     * The C Debug tool init_mode did not work on win32.
     * Support  for  the  vgencomp command was added to the PE version of
       ModelSim.
     * Running  vsim  in command line mode on windows and using CTRL-C to
       interrupt  the  simulator resulted in some of the characters typed
       at  the  VSIM  prompt being sent to the shell and not to vsim. The
       characters that did go to vsim were not displayed properly.
     * Verilog   configurations   that   were   instantiated  by  a  VHDL
       configuration did not work correctly in the GUI structure window.
     * Undocked  window panes that have been closed do not stay closed on
       the next invocation of ModelSim.
     * A  Tcl error occurred when undocking the Wave window after opening
       the Dataflow window.
     * ModelSim crashed if the first window encountered during invocation
       was  undocked.  Typically  this is the Workspace window, but it is
       not necessarily limited to this window.
     * The  -wlfnoopt switch now disables the WLF viewer from considering
       WLF optimizations when viewing a WLF file. Before this release the
       -wlfnoopt  switch  only  affected the writing of the WLF file--the
       WLF  viewer  always  used  optimization data if present in the WLF
       file.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * Attempting  to  log  SystemVerilog class instance variables (e.g.,
       "add  log -r /*") caused vsim to crash. Logging of class variables
       has been disabled.
     * Clock  event  suppression  optimizations  suppressed  valid  clock
       activity in some rare cases.
     * Verilog   configurations   that  were  instantiated  as  generated
       instances or an array of instances did not load correctly.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * DPI  calls  from  C  code  to  automatic  SystemVerilog  functions
       received a garbage return value.
     * The   acc_next_driver   routine   failed  to  return  any  of  the
       bidirectional  pass  switch  "tran"  primitives.  The  vpi_iterate
       routine  also  had  the same problem when iterating over vpiDriver
       types.
     * DPI  calls  from C code to automatic SystemVerilog functions would
       not  set  up  the  function arguments correctly (the SystemVerilog
       functions received a garbage value).
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * Shift  operations  whose  RHS was an integer sometimes crashed the
       simulator.  This occurred if the expression was evaluated when the
       RHS was uninitialized.
     * Type conversion expression syntax requires that the target type be
       specified   as   a   type_mark.   If   the   target   type  was  a
       subtype_indication, a warning message was not issued.
     * An  actual  that  is an expression may be associated with a formal
       port only if the mode of the port is IN. The previous behavior was
       that  vcom  accepted  it,  and the expression was unused (for mode
       OUT),  or had some unpredictable behavior (for modes other than IN
       and  OUT).  This is now a warning and becomes an error if the vcom
       -pedanticerrors switch is used.
     * The  implicit  "=" and "/=" operators for array types return false
       and true respectively if the operands are of different lengths. If
       this  situation  is  detected  by  vcom, then a warning message is
       produced.  In  prior  releases,  this warning message was produced
       only  if  the  -lint  switch  was  present.  Now,  this message is
       produced unconditionally.
     * On  64-bit  platforms, records containing access types had only 32
       bits  of  the  access type initialized to 0s. In most, but not all
       cases the other 32 bits were also 0s.
     * A class SIGNAL formal parameter is not allowed as the prefix of an
       attribute name whose designator is one of the predefined attribute
       names DELAYED STABLE QUIET TRANSACTION. The compiler inadvertently
       allowed  an  alias  to such a formal parameter to be used, causing
       unpredictable  results  in  the  simulator.  Such an alias in this
       situation now causes a compiler error.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 6.0c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 6.0c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * vsim  crashed  when  a  SC_METHOD  or SC_THREAD was created in the
       end_of_elaboration() function of a module.
     * sccom produced an error when a variable length array was used.
     * sccom  produced an error on a member function pointer with default
       arguments.
     * The   rising_edge()  VHDL  function  was  not  working  for  ports
       connected  to  SystemC.  The  last_value  of  VHDL  ports were not
       getting updated while propagating value from SystemC to VHDL.
     * scgenmod can now handle VHDL ports the sizes of which are declared
       in terms of locally static expressions.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * The  PSL  Fusion(:) operator incorrectly matched in the case where
       an operand of fusion was compared to an empty path.
     * Operand  of  non-consecutive  repeat  and  goto repeat can only be
       boolean. This was not enforced in earlier versions.
     * vcom  produced  an  error  while resolving argument of PSL builtin
       countones/onehot/onehot0/isunknown   as   PSL  bit-vector  if  the
       argument was a VHDL concatenation or a VHDL function call with PSL
       bit-vector return type.
     * vsim  crashed  when  a  non-consc/next-event  repeat is one of the
       members of SERE 'and' or SERE 'intersect'.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.0c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.0c
     * Reading  a  code  coverage  exclusion  file sometimes failed if at
       least one coverage report command was not done first.
     * Condition  coverage and branch coverage were not working correctly
       for   VHDL   conditional  signal  assignment  or  selected  signal
       assignment statements.
     * vcover  merge sometimes gave incorrect results when the data being
       merged came from VHDL packages.
     * There  was  a problems with negative VCD indices and illegal scope
       types names in vcd2wlf.
     * In  certain  cases  init_signal_spy  incorrectly  generated length
       mismatch  errors  when  one of the objects involved is a slice and
       the other object is not a slice and has no indices specified.
     * The  coverage  reload  command caused a spurious warning to appear
       about  failing  to  find  a  statement  when  there  were multiple
       statements on the same line.
     * The  preference variable PrefCoverage(pref_InitFilterFrom) did not
       work  properly in gui mode. When the variable is to the path of an
       exclusion  file,  that  file  should  be loaded automatically when
       coverage  is  enable. The variable now functions properly, in both
       batch and GUI mode.
     * When  using  the  memory viewer to initialize memory contents, the
       filling  of  memories  with  random pattern data for memories with
       word widths greater than 31 bits in certain cases resulted in only
       zeros  values  being set. This has now been partially corrected to
       ensure  that  the  lowest  32 bits of any word will always contain
       random  data;  however, any higher bits in the word (over 32) will
       still not get set to random values. This 32-bit limitation will be
       corrected in a future release.
     * Toggle coverage on large vectors (32,768 or more bits) resulted in
       a simulator crash.
     * The  default  Run  Length  was  incorrectly  scaled by 1 time unit
       (x1000)  after  each invocation when there is a difference in time
       units  between  resolution and UserTimeUnit. When using a project,
       the  modified  value  was  saved causing the default Run Length to
       reach the largest time value (millions of seconds).
     * The  vcover utility did not properly account for instance specific
       exclusions  or truth table row exclusions or branch exclusions. It
       also  gave  incorrect  results  for  some  incremental statistics.
       vcover  now  supports two new options, -bydu and -du <name>, which
       support  reporting  by  design unit or for a specific design unit.
       vcover does not yet support design unit toggle data.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 6.0c
     * If  you do a toggle add command on a group of signals and then try
       to  convert  those  toggles  to  extended mode by doing toggle add
       -full  on  the  same signals, nothing will change. The only way to
       change  the  internal  toggle triggers from 2-edge to 6-edge is to
       restart vsim and start with the right command.
     * Verilog configurations that are loaded by Verilog generates do not
       work correctly in the vopt flow.
     * vsim  will  crash with corrupted memory if branch code coverage is
       on and a verilog case statement has a case alternative that is not
       a constant, such as a parameter.

   Product Changes to 6.0c
     * When  using  code  coverage, statement coverage is no longer on by
       default. To turn it on you must compile with the -cover s switch.
     * When  using  code  coverage,  IF/ELSIF/ELSE/CASE statements are no
       longer  counted  in  statement  coverage;  they are handled in the
       branch statistics and reports.
     * Code coverage UDP tables for condition and expression coverage are
       now  able to do a better job of recognizing common subexpressions.
       Also, the columns for subexpressions was eliminated.
     * Toggle coverage data is now written by the coverage report command
       in  "by-instance" and "by-design-unit" modes. The data is reported
       now  by  the local name or port name, rather than by the connected
       signal.  In  "by-design-unit"  mode, the toggle data is the sum of
       all the instances of that design unit. Normally, only signals that
       are  deemed to be not toggled are written out, unless the new -all
       option is supplied to the coverage report command.
     * The  memory  profiler  will  no  longer  unwind  the callstack and
       collect  call tree information by default. Callstack collection is
       turned  on  from  the command line by adding +call to the -memprof
       option;  -memprof+call. At the modelsim prompt the command profile
       option collect_calltrees on will turn on callstack collection.

   New Features Added to 6.0c
     * A  -do  option  has  been  added  to the coverage report -excluded
       command  that  specifies  a  "do"  file  format using the coverage
       exclude -add commands.
     * The  coverage  exclude -add command is now able to accept multiple
       line number and range fields.
     * A  new  preference  option, PrefMain(ShowFilePane), has been added
       that  disables  the Files tab in the Workspace window. This option
       is useful when a design has a large number of files. Disabling the
       tab  will  speed  up  invocation  time of the U/I. By default, the
       Files  tab  is  enabled.  Valid  values  for this preference are 1
       (enabled) and 0 (disabled).
     * Increased performance of the delay net delay solver for situations
       where no solution found messages are generated.
     * The  coverage  report  command  has  a  new  mode:  in addition to
       "by-file"  and  "by-instance", it now has a "by-design-unit" mode.
       In  this  mode,  data  is reported for each entity/architecture or
       module,  with  statistics  being  summed  for all instances of the
       design  unit.  Toggle data is summed also, and is reported by port
       or  local  name  in  the design unit, rather than by the connected
       signal.  The  "by-design-unit"  mode can be turned on by the -bydu
       option,  or can be made the default by the command coverage report
       -setdefault  bydu.  To get a report on a specific design unit, use
       the  command  coverage report -du <du_name>... where <du_name> can
       be  of  the  form library.primary(secondary), in which library and
       secondary are optional.
     * The coverage report command now allows you to set the default mode
       to  either  "by-instance"  or  "by-file"  or "by-design-unit". The
       default  is  the  same  as previously, which is "by-file". Use the
       following       syntax:      coverage      report      -setdefault
       byfile|byinstance|bydu.  The  default  value  is  saved  using the
       variable  PrefCoverage(DefaultCoverageMode).  This variable can be
       set from the Edit preferences dialog.
