<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Virtual signals with the <b>-delay</b> option could not be added to the Wave window.</li>
<li>
Under some circumstances, the following incorrect error messages were displayed:<br>
<code>
"... Recursive kernel call. Cannot execute ...".
</code></li>
<li>
In certain cases, selecting processes in an undocked Dataflow window lead to the GUI locking up and becoming unresponsive.</li>
<li>
Closing a maximized MDI window (e.g. wave, source, dataflow, memory) resulted in an incorrect and unusable window layout in certain cases.</li>
<li>
The Wave window could hang after many 'zoom in' operations if an extremely large (e.g. >1,000,000 units) wave grid spacing was specified.</li>
<li>
An undocked workspace window now has a filter toolbar. This allows the dataset (sim) tab to be filtered when the workspace is undocked.</li>
<li>
Double clicking on a message in the msgviewer window that had no file information caused a Tcl error.</li>
<li>
After a restart operation the Wave windows current vertical scroll position is retained. Previously, after a restart the Wave windows verical scroll position was moved to the top.</li>
<li>
SystemC aggregate signals (such as an array of sc_signal<T>) did not log correctly if they were driven from HDL.</li>
<li>
Repositioning the simulation GUI toolbars was difficult. </li>
<li>
When hovering over a large record in the Wave window the balloon popup displaying the value displayed incorrectly or caused a crash.</li>
<li>
The diff.exe now is provided for win32, win32pe and win32<oem>.  This is needed for users who don't have diff.exe in their win32 system and try to use memtool "Compare Contents..." feature.</li>
<li>
The wlfman utility did not correctly preserve the signal mode (in, out, inout, or internal) in the output WLF file.  They were always marked as internal.</li>
<li>
Message Viewer window now can be closed.  A "x" icon is added when msgviewer window is created, and it is grayed out when transcript tab is selected. The "View" -> "Message Viewer" pulldown menu now is a toggle menu.</li>
<li>
Under certain cases an error resulted when attempting to bring up the cursor popup menu within the Wave window.</li>
<li>
When undocked, the Workspace window toolbar now displays the "contains:" filter toolbar.</li>
<li>
Users can now enter logical library names via the search library fields of the simulate and optimize design dialog boxes.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2d</b>
<ul>
<li>
Some of the SystemVerilog DPI open array API functions are not yet implemented.  An error message is issued if such a function is called from user C code. The error message incorrectly stated that the function couldn't be called from "within a thread". Now a more appropriate error message is issued.</li>
<li>
$ungetc was erroneously returning the value of the character argument when successful. It was modified to return zero as per IEEE 1364-2005.</li>
<li>
There was a compilation error when correctly using void'() on a system function to discard the return value.
</li>
<li>
There was a compilation error when correctly assigning an enum array element imported from a package to an enum variable of the same kind.
</li>
<li>
Hierarchical calls in fork..join blocks inside of automatic tasks sometimes crashed the simulator.</li>
<li>
Using "ref" task arguments in a fork..join block in a task generated the following internal compiler error:<br>
<code>
** Error: ** Error: fork_tasks.sv(39): Internal error:
../../../src/vlog/vgendecl.c(8367) idx >= 0 && idx <
block_shared_item_countOf(block)
</code>
</li>
<li>
The Verilog parser reported incorrect line numbers after a multi-line macro had been expanded.
</li>
<li>
Though it was a documented option, vlog gave an error saying <b>-force_refresh</b> was an unknown option.</li>
<li>
The compiler crashed on 64-bit platforms in some cases of optimizing expressions.</li>
<li>
A final block that generated events on logged signals and was triggered by a $finish() task (as opposed to the command line quit command) crashed.</li>
<li>
The simulator no longer errors on Verilog command line options which start with <b>+acc</b> but are not PLI or debug command access options such as <b>+access+r+w</b>.

</li>
<li>
There was a $countdrivers issue in mixed-language design where drivers from the upper hierarchy of a net were missed, thus an incorrect value was returned.
</li>
<li>
The names created for an array of instances of bidirectional pass switches were incorrect, and caused the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
When multiple <b>+libext</b> arguments were sent to the compiler and several matching files were found, the compilation did not stop after compiling the first match. This resulted in the intended module definition being overwritten with the last file compiled.</li>
<li>
An optimized design not at the top of the hierarchy using the optimized design name in the HDL source code could not be instatiated.</li>
<li>
Some forms of multiplexers implemented as continuous assignments behaved incorrectly when optimized if the "select" vector was declared with an ascending range rather than a descending range.</li>
<li>
A clocking block event failed to work when accessed through a virtual interface.</li>
<li>
A clocking block input variable failed to register a value when declared within a parameterized virtual interface.</li>
<li>
A design with input to input INTERCONNECT delay annotations using the option <b>+multisource_int_delays</b> on vector ports crashed the simulator.</li>
<li>
An $sdf_annotate call that did not explicitly specify the target instance to annotate failed to annotate the correct instance (the parent module of the $sdf_annotate call) if the parent module was inlined in an optimized design.</li>
<li>
A module instantiation containing a part-select of a variable, where one of the bounds depends on a user-defined function, in certain cases caused the simulator to crash during elaboration.</li>
<li>
vlog crashed when an edge identifer was used in the default clocking skew of a clocking block. </li>
<li>
When the <b>-sv</b> switch was not specified, vlog did not correctly flag the illegal use of null statements in sequential and parallel statement blocks as errors.
</li>
<li>
When the <b>-sv</b> switch was not specified, vlog did not correctly flag functions declared without any inputs as errors.</li>
<li>
Specializing a parameterized class in a module instance with a bind construct  caused a fatal error in some cases.</li>
<li>
The $fmonitor system task failed to reread the file argument if it changed value after the call to $fmonitor and if the design was either System Verilog or an unoptimized design.</li>
<li>
Under some circumstances, missed checking for all pure virtual methods overrides in case of derived parameterized classes.</li>
<li>
When the <b>-sv</b> switch was not specified, vlog did not correctly flag the use of statement labels as errors.</li>
<li>
Name collisions between System Verilog named blocks (and labeled statements) that share the same parent scope are now correctly identified and reported as errors.</li>
<li>
The "foreach" statement did not always work properly on arrays of class handles. </li>
<li>
Declaring a dynamic array in a normal Verilog source file mistakenly enabled System Verilog compatibility even when vlog was invoked without the <b>-sv</b> switch.</li>
<li>
vlog crashed when a clocking block skew contained both an edge and a delay.</li>
<li>
Gate-level optimized cells with wired tristate primitive drivers on edge sensitive  logic may not evaluate correctly in some situations.</li>
<li>
An optimized always construct implementing latch-like behavior skipped evaluations of the latch enable under some unusual circumstances if the sensitivity list also contained a signal not read in the body of the always construct.</li>
<li>
The error checking for a blocking assignment to a hierarchical path was too strict.</li>
<li>
When the annotation point specified with the <b>-sdfmax</b>, -<b>sdftyp</b> or <b>-sdfmin</b> options was neither a fully rooted path name nor immediately under the top level of hierarchy, and the design was optimized the simulator crashed. </li>
<li>
Having multiple hierarchical references using $root could result in hierarchical name resolution failures.</li>
<li>
Using event triggers on a class field of type "event" caused a crash in vsim on 64-bit platforms.</li>
<li>
Calling some system functions from within an automatic task or function that contained no variable declarations crashed the simulator with a segmentation fault.</li>
<li>
Using a system function call as an actual to a system task call (e.g. $display($time)) resulted in memory corruption and simulation failure in some complex scenarios.</li>
<li>
If a system function call with automatic arguments was nested inside another system task or function call, the value passed to the outer call was incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2d</b>
<ul>
<li>
The tf_infonode PLI routine returned the wrong handle in bit select node.</li>
<li>
Under some circumstances, a VPI iteration for vpiLoad on a vpiNet or vpiNetBit handle looped endlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2d</b>
<ul>
<li>
If the actual expression of an association list was in the form of a function call with multiple constant arguments, the compiler erroneously classify the expression as a type conversion function, and issue the following error:
<br>
<code>
Error: ...: (vcom-1042) Conversion function ... must have exactly one formal parameter.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In an association list containing an individually associated formal, where there appears a formal designator that is a slice of the formal, and where the formal is of an unconstrained array type, the LRM requires that the direction of the slice discrete range be the same as the direction of the index subtype of the array type.  In legacy releases, this rule was not enforced and instead, the direction of the formal was obtained from the direction of the slice discrete range.  Recently, a strict enforcement of this rule was added.  This release, however, reverts back to the non-compliant behavior.  All slices for a given formal associated individually must have the same direction, and this direction will determine the direction of the (unconstrained array type) formal being associated.</li>
<li>
vcom and vopt crashed when an alias to a function was called as a unary or binary operator.</li>
<li>
In an optimized VHDL design containing a black boxed instance and unbound instances in certain cases unexpected simulation results ocurred. The problem showed up as signals having unexpected "U" values.</li>
<li>
vopt erroneously reported out-of-bounds errors for generic and port associations occurring in generate blocks that vopt determined would not be evaluated. Given the component declaration below:
<br>
<code>
component comp is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    generic(gcomp : natural)<br>
end component;<br>
</code>
If vopt determined generic g evaluates to 1, then compilation of the following generate statement erroneously reported an out-of-range error.
<br>
<code>
gen_comp : if g /= 1 generate<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   inst_comp : component comp generic map(gcomp => -1);<br>
end generate;<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
Optimizations caused incorrect drivers on composite signals on output parameters to subprograms. This caused the simulator to crash.</li>
<li>
For a class SIGNAL mode OUT formal parameter of an unconstrained array type where the element subtype is also an array, the 'LENGTH computation was incorrect for optimzation level <b>-O4</b> or higher.</li>
<li>
Implicit concatenation with an operand of an unconstrained array type (e.g. a function call) resulted in a simulator crash in some cases.</li>
<li>
In some circumstances, incorrect simulation results occurred when an "if" statement condition used an indexed signal name prefix of a 'EVENT attribute name.</li>
<li>
For the 6.2c release, a configuration specification whose generic map had an unassociated (or OPEN) array type generic whose corresponding entity generic had a locally static default expression caused a message such as:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vcom/genexpr.c(5483).
</code>
<br>
In older releases, this configuration specification caused intermittent crashes.</li>
<li>
When optimizing a VHDL design, vopt would incorrectly exit while reporting a circular dependency when two package bodies referenced each other's package header.</li>
<li>
When optimizing a VHDL design, if different parts of the design were compiled with different levels of optimizations, in certain cases vsim generated the error message:<br>
<code>
# ** INTERNAL ERROR: export_lookup() failed.<br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
Under rare circumstances a recursive call procedure call chain caused
a stack overflow and vcom crash.</li>

When a black box instantiated VHDL, vsim did not 
find the info file for the standard package and the following error messages were produced:<br>
<code>
# ** Error: (vsim-7) Failed to open info file "work/_opt/__model_tech_.._std__info" in read mode.<br>
# No such file or directory. (errno = ENOENT)
</code>
</li>
<li>
If the <b>drivers</b> command was applied to a Verilog input port that was driven in a VHDL upper level architecture, the command reported drivers on the upper level signal, but omitted any Verilog drivers on the port. If there were conflicting values driven onto the port within the Verilog module, the drivers report provided misleading information.</li>
<li>
An integer type VHDL generic associated with a System Verilog parameter resized the parameter to 32-bits in the case that the parameter was not explicitly typed and the default value was a 2-state value of a size other than 32-bits. The intention was for the parameter to retain its default size.</li>
<li>
Escaped identifiers in the hierarchical path name of source ports in INTERCONNECT delays were not processed correctly.</li>
<li>
In some situations annotating multisource INTERCONNECT delays to VITAL models, when the source port is on an optimized Verilog module, caused a crash.</li>
<li>
vopt crashed on a top-level design name of the form library.module, when the library name contained one or more "+" characters. </li>
<li>
If there are multiple instances of a VHDL design unit instantiated below a hierarchy in which levels of Verilog and VHDL designs are interspersed, vopt may infer incorrect constant values for generics of some of the instances which resulted in the following warning from vsim:<br>
<code>
** Warning: (vsim-8148) The constant value inferred for generic 'g' is different from the value that was posted.
</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The Signal Spy function signal_release() errored out when a valid enumerated value was used as the index of a vectored signal.  The function now correctly handles valid enumerated values. </li>
<li>
Under some circumstances, incorrect conditional timing check violations were reported.</li>
<li>
Hold timing check violation is missing when data and ref events occur at the same time due to a Performance optimization. The problem is fixed.</li>
<li>
vmakes output was not correct when embedded spaces were in the source file path name. A backslash is now added in this case (e.g.  "A B" --> "A\ B"). This applies to both embedded spaces in the directory name and file name.</li>
<li>
vopt tried to unlink 64 or 32-bit asm files from a read-only library.</li>
<li>
The wlfman utility crashed in some cases when trying to filter a System Verilog array of structs signals.</li>

<li>
vmake now handles multiple source files per design unit. This enhancement also supports Verilog include files plus Verilog and VHDL PSL vunit files.
</li>
<li>
scgenmod now has a <b>-createtemplate</b> option to create class template declaration of a foreign module with integer template arguments corresponding to the integer parameter or generic defined in the VHDL or Verilog module. Ports in VHDL and Verilog modules instantiated from SystemC can now have thier range specified in terms of integer parameters or generics. Such port ranges will be specified in terms of the template arguments of the the foreign module. </li>
<li>
JobSpy now supports SGE task arrays. Simulation jobs use SGE_TASK_ID as well as JOB_ID environment variables.  The <b>jobspy</b> command can reference these jobs as "taskid.jobid".</li>
<li>
JobSpy can now be used without running a jobspy daemon.  If the JOBSPY_DAEMON environment variable is set to a directory rather than a port@host, then simulation jobs will create files in that directory with the job's information.  The <b>jobspy</b> command and GUI will then use that information rather than gettting it from the daemon.</li>
<li>
JobSpy now supports the <b>profile</b> simulator command.  This command can be given while the remote simulation is running or not.  The usage is:<br>
<code>
jobspy  _jobid_  profile on | off | save [filename]
</code></li>
<li>
Support was added for the Verilog ternary operator in condition and expression
coverage truth tables. Support was also added for Hi-Z states in the UDP for
arguments of the ternary operator. Truth table rows that contain Z's are
automatically excluded from coverage counting, unless it is overrided by
using the vsim <b>-noexcludehiz</b> option.

Cdebug support for SystemC module instance-based C breakpoints has been added. To specify the instance of the SystemC module as a C breakpoint condition, use the <b>bp</b> command and switch <b>-inst &lt;SystemC-module-instance-hier-name&gt;</b>. For example: 
<br>
bp -c -inst "sctop.a.b" ...
<br>
bp -c -inst "sctop.a.c*" ...
<br>
bp -c -inst "/sctop/a/c* sctop/a/b" ...
<br>

The switches <b>-cond</b> and <b>-inst</b> can be used together.  Wildcards are supported.  The path separator in hierarchical names can be Verilog or VHDL style, or the one specified in modelsim.ini can be used. If multiple <b>-inst</b> switches are used, the last one wins.

<li>
The <B>-du &lt;design unit&gt;</B> switch was added to vmake to generate makefiles  for specific design unit(s). The <B>-du</B> switch can be used more than once to include multiple design units.</li>
<li>
The Objects window has a new filter for removing Parameters and Generics from the window.  Filters are found under the View menu.</li>
<li>
The new CLI commmand, <b>find insource pattern</b> searches all source files related to the current design and prints lines from files that match the <b>pattern</b> argument.  A double-click on the reported matching lines in the Transcript window will open the file and display the reported lines containing the pattern match. Regular expression wildcards may be used in the pattern to further restrict the matches.</li>
<li>
The new CLI command, <b>find infiles</b> &lt;<i>string pattern</i>&gt; &lt;<i>file pattern...</i>&gt; will search the specified files for matching strings.  Lines matching the pattern will be listed in the Transcript window. A double-click on the matching lines reported in the Transcript window will open the file and display the reported lines.</li>
<li>
The <b>+dumpports+collapse</b> switch was added to vsim for collapsing vectors in dumpports output. Dumpports output can also be controlled with the modelsim.ini entry:<br>
<code>
  DumpportsCollapse = 0
</code>
<br>
Starting with 6.2d the default setting for "DumpportsCollapse" is off (0).
