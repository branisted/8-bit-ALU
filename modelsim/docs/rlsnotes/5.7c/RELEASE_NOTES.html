<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 5.7 
Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your Libraries" 
in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for more information on refreshing your models. 
</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
Product changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in the 5.7c 
release. If you are migrating to the 5.7c release from 5.6x or earlier releases,
please also consult version 5.7x release notes for product changes and new 
features introduced during the 5.7 patch releases. The previous version 
release notes can be found in your modeltech installation directory at 
docs/rlsnotes.
</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
The following platforms will be discontinued as of the ModelSim 5.8 release:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Redhat Linux 6.0 
<LI>Redhat Linux 6.1 
</UL>
</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   </ul>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
When ModelSim was installed in a directory whose name contained spaces, 
invocation of the Tcl debugger reported an error and failed to load. The 
installation directory's name was incorrectly inserted into the initial list of
properties.</li>
<li>
Signals with large value strings (e.g. large arrays) caused some Xservers 
to crash when displayed in the Signals window.</li>
<li>
Virtual signal definitions of the form &lt;name&gt;'(' &lt;expression&gt; ')'
were incorrectly handled in the case where the &lt;name&gt; was a hierarchical
name using '.' as the path separator.  The GUI created a virtual with
the value &lt;expression&gt; instead of an indexed name.

</li>
<li>
When the entire design was logged, <b>restart</b> in some cases took much more
time to complete than the original design logging and load. The problem occurred
with large designs containing design objects filtered out with wildcards.</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window displayed only the first of multiple primitives instantiated
on the same line. (e.g. and (N1,A1,A2),(N2,B1,B2),(N3,C1,C2),(N4,D1,D2) ).
You must recompile the module containing the instantiation to get the bug fix.</li>
<li>
In the Source window, the examine popup failed with a Tcl error when the object
was a constant.</li>
<li>
Expanding a library in the library tab of the Main window resulted in a
crash if a design unit in the library did not have a source file entry
in the library database (an abnormal condition).
</li>
<li>
The Wave window textColor setting was being ignored.</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window did not properly represent concurrent conditional 
assignment statements if the RHS expression involved indexed items.  The fix 
for this is in the compiler, vcom, therefore the VHDL model must be recompiled
to see the fix.</li>
<li>
ModelSim failed to invoke if the saved geometry of the Main window had a negative offset (i.e. the window origin was off the screen to the left and above the top.)</li>
<li>
The <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> options to the <b>view</b> command would not accept negative 
origin values.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Optimization of continuous assignment statements with more than 64 variables
and operators caused an internal buffer to overflow by one byte. On certain
platforms (e.g., Linux), the one-byte overflow caused the compiler to crash.</li>
<li>
The $display format "%F" was not being correctly handled on all platforms.</li>
<li>
The compiler crashed when compiling with <b>-fast</b> if the design contained 
an out-of-bounds bit-select of a vector port of an inlined module instance.
</li>
<li>
The <b>+no_notifier</b> and <b>+no_tchk_msg</b> switches were not correctly 
reflected by the timing check status commands <b>tcheck_status</b> and 
<b>tcheck_set</b>.</li>
<li>
A relational operator evaluated to an incorrect result if both operands
were a call to the same function.
</li>
<li>
Hierarchical assignments with optimized Verilog cell output ports,
were using the output's pending value rather than output's driven value.</li>
<li>
A module having a long name (several hundred characters) or special characters
in the name could not be recompiled into the same library without generating
a false error.
</li>
<li>
A signed operand was sign extended when lengthened no matter what the result
type of the containing expression was. Operands should be sign extended only
if the expression result type is signed.
</li>
<li>
When compiling modules that were enclosed in a `protect...`endprotect block, 
the _primary.vhd file should not be generated.</li>
<li>
vlog produced corrupt library files on 64-bit big-endian platforms 
(sunos5v9, hppa64, rs64) leading to a <b>refresh</b> failure with the following
error message:<BR>
<code>
"** Error: work/.../_primary.dat(...): resetall already declared in this scope".
</code></li>
<li>
A relational operator expression having an operand that is a concatenation of
just one net resulted in a compiler internal error.</li>
<li>
The <b>step -over</b> command misbehaved on the hp700 platform by stepping into
Verilog functions.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The PLI returned an incorrect value for a system task argument if the argument
was an out-of-bounds bit-select of a vector net. This also affected built-in
system tasks such as $display.
</li>
<li>
Usage of acc_handle_object() with optimized Verilog cells worked
only when compiled with <b>+acc=p</b>.</li>
<li>
Name lookup in the VPI used VHDL-style extended identifier parsing 
(name enclosed within backslashes) instead of Verilog-style escaped identifier 
parsing (name starts with '\' and ends with ' ').  Now name lookup in the VPI
first tries using context-based parsing where if the context is VHDL then the
VHDL-style extended identifier parsing is used and if the context is Verilog
then the Verilog-style escaped identifier parsing is used.  Here is an
example:<br>
 "/\\VHDL testbench\\/uut/\\vlog instance /net1".<br>
If the context-based parsing does not succeed in finding a match and the name
contains a backslash then an attempt is made to parse the name using only
Verilog-style escaped identifier parsing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Calling a user-defined log function which had the same name as a built-in math 
function but different argument types generated bad code and caused the 
simulation to crash.</li>
<li>
The simulator did not generate errors on invalid aliases.  The following
conditions resulted in the error not being flagged:<br>
<UL>
<LI>The alias had to be an array type.
<LI>The subtype indication for the alias had to be constrained.
<LI>The subtype constraint or the actual's constraint had to be not locally static.
</UL>
If all three conditions were met, the compiler could not check the validity of
the alias and a size check had to be done at simulation time.  The error was
that this runtime check was not generated.</li>
<li>
When there were two clocked processes within distinct architectures, use of the
<b>examine</b> command to view signals present in at least one of the 
architectures resulted in a simulator crash.</li>
<li>
In some cases vsim crashed due to incorrect code generation. In order for
this crash to occur the following conditions had to be true:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Multiple design units had to be compiled with one <b>vcom</b> command.
<LI>One of the design units compiled had to be a package body (A).
<LI>There had to be a reference to package body A's header before the
   definition of package body A.
<LI>The design unit that referenced package body A's header had to have
   a string literal of a type defined in package body A's header.
</UL> 

</li>
<li>
An alias to an array signal in a package crashed at load time if the 
alias was declared in an entity. The work around is to declare the alias 
in the architecture.</li>
<li>
The initial value of a signal could be incorrectly set if the
signal had an explicit initial value, was of type array or record,
was connected to a out or inout port, and the port declaration did not
have an explicit initial value.  The signal's explicit initial value
was incorrectly used to initialize the lower level drivers of the port.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Calls to FLI initialization functions that occurred during <b>restore</b> and 
<b>load_elab</b> did not have the same current context setting as their 
occurrences during a normal design instantiation.</li>
<li>
Calls to mti_FindVar() and mti_FirstVar() resulted in a crash after 
<b>restart</b>.
</li>
<li>
mti_GetParentSignal() was incorrectly returning the parent of a signal (of 
direction IN) that was connected via a port mapping which included a type 
conversion or conversion function.  mti_GetParentSignal() will now correctly
return a NULL in this case.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vitaldefects"></a><b>VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
When a path delay from a bit of a bus to an output was specified, the wrong 
delay was selected in some cases. The 'last_event attribute used for the path 
delay was incorrectly updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Coverage reports using the <b>-lines</b> option had incorrect headers for the
branch information. The "True" and "False" branch headings were reversed.</li>
<li>
A false "SDF Backannotation Successfully Completed" message was issued if
the ModelSim application previously ran a simulation with SDF and then ran
another simulation without SDF in the same invocation of the ModelSim
application.
</li>
<li>
The simulator was not reporting errors that occurred when writing a checkpoint 
file (for example when the disk became full). The checkpoint file appeared to 
be written successfully but the restore reported errors about reading an 
incorrect number of bytes.</li>
<li>
The command <b>run -over</b> did not perform the same action as <b>step -over</b>. </li>
<li>
The <b>vmake</b> command now ignores objects compiled with <b>-nodebug</b>.
Previously an incomplete make file was generated when a <b>-nodebug</b> 
compiled object was encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="mgcdefects"></a><b>Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
DR336547 - Wrong/invalid port connection not caught.<br>
When a Verilog module instantiated a VHDL entity with too many ports or
parameters, no warning/error message was produced if the entity instantiated
another Verilog module.</li>
<li>
DR337391 - Crash on vcdstim.<br>
When using the <b>-vcdstim</b> option with a vcd file (not extended vcd) and a 
Verilog top level, the simulator crashed.</li>
<li>
DR338795 - Memory leak loading design on Solaris.<br>
vsim could use all memory and then crash with a fatal memory allocation failure while loading a large design on sunos5 or sunos5v9 platforms.
</li>
<li>
ER338202 - Add optimization for inlined Verilog modules with distributed delays and no path delays.<br>

Verilog modules without path delays are uneffected by the <b>delay_mode_path</b>
option and Verilog modules with path delays are not inlined.
The new vsim option <b>+nocheckDELAY</b> when used in conjunction
with <b>delay_mode_path</b> allows inlined Verilog modules with distributed 
delays and no path delays to be cell optimized.</li>
<li>
DR337577 - mgls_asynch failed to reconnect to application which called it after 
an unexpected exit.</li>
<li>
DR338791 - Getting a stack trace and the simulator exits with an error code 211.</li>
<li>
DR336922 - Arithmetic function causes ModelSim to crash on Solaris.<br>
Calling a user defined log function with the same name as a built-in math function, but different argument types generated bad code. This resulted in a simulation crash.</li>
<li>
DR338145 - vlog error: can't compile while ok with Modelsim 5.6e.</li>
<li>
DR336171 - Multiple instances on one line render differently/wrong in Dataflow window.<br>
The Dataflow window displayed only the first of multiple primitives instantiated
on the same line. (e.g. and (N1,A1,A2),(N2,B1,B2),(N3,C1,C2),(N4,D1,D2) ). You
must recompile the module containing the instantiation to get the bug fix.</li>
<li>
DR335967 - The <b>examine</b> command does not work properly in the Source window.</li>
<li>
DR338083 - PLI Documentation incorrect.<br>
<pre>
ModelSim SE User's Manuel   page 133
   64-bit Solaris platform
        cc -v -xarch=v9 -O -I$/<install_dir>/modeltech/include -c app.c
        ld -G -B symbolic app.o -o app.so
The "-I$/" is incorrect and should be just "-I"
</pre></li>
<li>
ER335604 - LIC: Rqst that ModelSim PE does not block an OEM version of ModelSim.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="knowndefects"></a><b>Known Defects in 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The following type of window geometry value, WxH-x-y, (for example,
600x300-10-20) set by PrefGeometry in the modelsim.tcl is not
supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
The <b>when</b> command now supports the use of  <, >, <=, and >= for time, 
real, and integer expressions. These operations can also be used with $now.</li>
<li>
Changed the limitation that allows running only one instance of PE on a machine with a node-locked license so that one instance of any OEM can be run on the same machine where one instance of PE is running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 5.7c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Preference variables have been added for the Dataflow window (PrefDataflow) to control user's preferences of the following Dataflow window features:
<pre>
    hidecells      -- Hide the internals of a library cell.
    inoutlocation  -- Place inout pins on bottom of symbol.
    keepdataflow   -- Keep previous contents when adding new nets or instances.
    lognets        -- Log nets when they are added to the Dataflow window.
    nosprout       -- Disable sprouting.
    selectenv      -- Change environment on selection in the Dataflow window.
    selequivnets   -- Selection of nets that traverse hierarchy will cause 
                      all the equivalent nets to be selected.
    showhierarchy  -- Display connectivity using hierarchical instances.
    symlibs        -- List of symbol definition files.
</pre></li>
<li>
There is now support for Verilog-XL system tasks $disable_warnings and $enable_warnings.</li>
<li>
A new FLI function, mti_SignalIsResolved(), can be used to find out
if a specified signal is resolved or not.  For details please see the
Foreign Language Interface manual.
</li>
<li>
Users can now access the vlog compile switch, <b>-vlog95compat</b>, from 
Modelsim's compile dialog box or by setting the value "vlog95compat = 1" in the
modelsim.ini file.  This change produces a compatibility issue with existing
project files and requires that all existing projects be converted to the
new version. The need for conversion is detected when opening a project
and happens automatically. Since the new project format is not backward
compatible, the user is prompted as to where a copy of the original project
should be placed.</li>
