<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
When using analog formatting it was possible for the waveform to be drawn outside of its row</li>
<li>
The <b>drivers</b> command displayed MIPD or anonymous for nets that had interconnect delays.
The problem is fixed to display the appropriate driver name.
</li>
<li>
"Identify Memories Within Cells" was not working properly through the GUI menu in the Memory window.
</li>
<li>
The "Expand Packed Memories" menu was not functioning properly and it was not updating the Memory window correctly when toggling its value. It has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem where the display of a Verilog register signals would be missing transitions when zoomed out. </li>
<li>
Fixed some inconsistencies in the command completion behavior within the Transcript window</li>
<li>
Within a given VHDL architecture, if multiple blocks exist with the same name,
objects declared within the blocks would get confused. This would result in incorrect results for the <b>add log</b>, <b>add wave</b>, <b>add list</b>, and <b>examine</b> commands.
</li>
<li>
Verilog process variables can now be logged.</li>
<li>
The simulator crashed when trying to add a SystemVerilog static string array into the Wave window or List window.
</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog inout typed enums did not show any value in the Wave window.
</li>
<li>
In Wave window, expanding any bus which has been assigned a color causes a crash of the simulator.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
Testplan Import in the Verification Manager failed if the directory or filename of the input or output files had spaces in them.</li>
<li>
For the Wave window, the Save Image dialog accessed via File->Export->Image... menu pick did not automatically add the .bmp extension when Files of type was set to "Bitmap (*.bmp)".
</li>
<li>
Wave window postscript printing does not work with some printers.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
Verilog reg bits and VHDL array elements where sometimes displayed incorrectly when the display was zoomed out. </li>
<li>
The simulator now supports the restoration of source files with a restored layout.  The Layout->Configure menu pick raises a dialog which allows a user to set their layout preferences.  If the "Restore Source..." choice is selected, the source files that were open when the layout was last saved will also be restored.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
Non-protected design units following a protected region read with vlog could cause design corruption. </li>
<li>
Print an error (vlog-2244) when a variable has an initializer, and that variable defaults to 'static' in a spot where it could be declared 'automatic', and where the initializer might be expected to be evaluated more than once.  This error is suppressible.  For example:<br>
<code>
forever begin
<br>int i = 3;  // Error, since 'i' defaults to static.
<br>static int j = 4;  // Okay.
<br>automatic int k = 5; // Okay.
</code></li>
<li>
Nested system function calls such as the following might have given wrong results.<br>
<code>res = $bitstoreal($realtobits(x)) / $bitstoreal($realtobits(y));</code>
</li>
<li>
An aggregate rand_mode status of dynamic array is now maintained. A call to the rand_mode task of a dynamic array (e.g. "dyn_arry.rand_mode(0)") will:
<ul>
<li> set the rand_mode of each element of the array;
<li> set the 'aggregate' rand_mode of the array (new behavior).
</ul>
On a subsequenet call to randomize, the 'aggregate' rand_mode status is tested before resizing the dynamic array. If the aggregate rand_mode is inactive (0) the array will not be resized.
</li>
<li>
vlog now treats files with extensions of .svh as SystemVerilog by default.</li>
<li>
We now support external references to queues.  Example:
<br>initial begin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; packet apkt = new;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int idx[$];
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idx = top.q.find_first_index with (do_comp(apkt,item));
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; top.q = top.q[idx[0]+1:$];
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
</li>
<li>
Port handles of a module instance specified as an argument to $dumpports are now automatically preserved in an optimized design.</li>
<li>
When a part select expression is used as LHS of an 'inside' operator, it would sometimes produce this internal error:<br>
<code>
Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(10888) !is_cancelledOf(e) 
</code>
<br>
and in some cases it would give wrong results. This is now fixed.
</li>
<li>
In some cases 'real' values passed over 'real' to 'real' module ports might have rounded off to integers. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>
Unpacked arrays used as RHS of 'inside' operators might have produced illegal errors in the incremental flow such as:<br>
<code>
Error: (vsim-3978) test.v(10): Cannot mix packed and unpacked
types in this operation.
</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple macros can be both defined and used within the context of another macro.
</li>
<li>
Simulatenous data and reference events to $setuphold & $recrem can cause redundant timing check violation messages to be generated.</li>
<li>
Event triggers on non-static class properties were not being sensitized to changes in the class variable.  If the class handle change results in a different value for the trigger expression, the event will now be triggered.</li>
<li>
When vlog was compiling code in a SystemVerilog $unit scope it failed to clean up library files generated for other platforms.  This could result in other platforms executing with older compiled versions of the code.</li>
<li>
Passing compilation unit name as a design unit to vopt might have resulted in a crash. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>
A verilog file was parsed as a SV file when vlog was run with -mfcu and one of the files had something in $unit scope.</li>
<li>
<code>vlog</code> and <code>vopt</code> would sometimes report an internal error when a hierarchical reference was used to call <code>first()</code>, <code>last()</code>, <code>next()</code> and <code>prev()</code> on an associative array.  The error message was:<br><code>
** Error: bug.sv(14): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgenexpr.c(7833) t
</code></li>
<li>
Some optimized sequential cell does not function correctly after a timingcheck violation. Its output would appear stuck at X.  </li>
<li>
Using sampled value functions like <code>$sampled</code>, <code>$rose</code> or <code>$fell</code> in a fork..join_none or fork..join_any block that was not inside a task or function generated the following internal error in some cases:<br>
<code>** Error: test.sv(17): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(77)
vl_save_stack_on_wait</code>
</li>
<li>
Declaration a parameter or localparam with a complex value expression inside of a task or function would sometimes give an internal error like:<br><code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;** Error: test.sv(12): Internal error: ../../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(129)
vl_save_stack_on_wait</code></li>
<li>
vlog would crash when reading the Verilog source text "`pragma reset protect".</li>
<li>
The wrong delay path is selected when an unoptimized Verilog cell specifies the delay path as "dataa *> dataout".
</li>
<li>
Assigning an unsized 'x' or 'z' to a register wider than 32-bits only set the low 32-bits.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a NAME="plidefects"></a><b>PLI Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
The vpiReg and vpiNet iterations on vpiRegArray and vpiNetArray objects respectively used to return elemental objects indexed through the full range of indices, including packed indices. This has been changed so that only the unpacked indices are iterated. Thus it is now possible for these iterations to return objects of type vpiPackedArrayNet or vpiPackedArrayVar; or nets and regs with multiple packed ranges.

This change is in line with an IEEE clarification for the behavior of these iterations on arrays with at least one unpacked and one or more packed ranges.</li>
<li>
This release enhances support for the placement of VPI Value Change Callbacks on aggregate net constructs and their subelements. Certain cases are not yet fully supported, in particular, vpiStructNets and their decompositions.</li>
<li>
<br>For a bit select of an unpacked wire object, which is in itself a packed vector, the function acc_handle_tfarg() will now return the acc object handle correctly, while acc_fetch_value() will return the value of this acc object correctly.<BR>
For example, for the array:<BR>
	<code>wire [3:0] clk_a_phasesel [3:0];</code><BR>
The calls to acc_handle_tfarg() and acc_fetch_value()involving the object <code>clk_a_phasesel[3]</code>
will work correctly.<BR>
Previously, both the functions returned NULL for this case.
</li>
<li>
This release fixes some problems with the bits derived by VPI iteration on some classes of nets and ports. </li>
<li>
Some learn mode defects have been fixed. One defect caused the simulator to crash when the VPI application used the vpi_put_value() function under certain conditions. Another defect caused the simulator to crash for some SignalSpy usages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="vhdldefects"></a><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
Under some conditions the drivers of a process could be determined incorrectly. This would result in either an error if the signals are not resolved or multiple drivers would be created if the signals are resolved.</li>
<li>
VHDL file operations now support large files (>2Gbytes) on 32-bit OSes that support 64-bit files.
</li>
<li>
Illegal type conversions on formal ports are now correctly flagged. Previously the simulator could crash or give invalid values.</li>
<li>
Complex expressions in the binding indications of a component configuration
could be incorrectly optimized.</li>
<li>
A protected method call was erroneously not allowed in a concurrent procedure call statement.  Now it is allowed.</li>
<li>
The simulator could crash when elaborating a design with a subtype local to a function and in which the subtype refers to array attributes of the return value of that function.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="flidefects"></a><b>FLI Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
mti_GetSignalSubelements would incorrectly report an error if the signal argument was a signal that did not contain any scalar signals.  A signal will not contain any scalar signals if it is an array of length 0 (NULL array) or is record with no fields or all the fields are NULL arrays.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="systemcdefects"></a><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for SystemVerilog disable statement that involves DPI-SC calls.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="assertiondefects"></a><b>Assertion Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
When the vsim <b>-assertdebug</b> switch is not specified, assertion pass reporting is not enabled.  The assertion GUI and reports have been changed to reflect that pass settings are not being honored by showing a "-" in their fields.
</li>
<li>
When the top hierarchy and thread life panes in the ATV window were sized such that the user needs to scroll to the bottom to see the bottom terms (in normal descending order), the bottom term was not visible in the names hierarchy pane.  It was hidden below the scrollbar.</li>
<li>
When the thread life pane in the ATV window was sized such that the pane was
too short to see the entire assertion expression but was long enough to see the
entire thread life, the stipple pattern shadding only went to the right side of
the visible area, and when scrolled to the right (to see the right side of the
assertion expression) the stipple pattern was absent.</li>
<li>
When undocked, the View menu for the ATV window was blank.</li>
<li>
vsim crashed when using boolean repeats with repeat count greater than 10,000.
</li>
<li>
vlog gave a parsing error for valid embedded PSL code present in a module compiled with the <b>-v</b> switch which is not being used in the design.
</li>
<li>
Forward referencing in now supported in PSL.</li>
<li>
vlog gave an error when the concatenation operator '{var}' was used in PSL built-in functions.
</li>
<li>
Use of unclocked PSL built-ins in an abort expression caused vlog to give an internal error.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>

<p><a NAME="mixeddefects"></a><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="coverage"></a><b>Coverage Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
In Compiler Options Coverage tab GUI the following changes are made.
<ul>
<li>The <b>-cover</b> has changed to <b>+cover</b>
<li>Corrected the optimization level option to <b>-coveropt</b>
<li>Removed the Ignore VHDL Subprograms checkbutton
</ul>
</li>
<li>
FSM transitions were not getting covered by the initial value of the current state variable. This has now been fixed.
</li>
<li>
The <b>-ignoredusig</b> option is added in vcover merge to disable the design unit signature checking for detecting source code mismatch between merging UCDB files. The following description should be added to document this option.
<br>
<UL>
By default the simulator performs checks on source code stability when performing
operations like merging statement coverage, or other source-based data.
If one UCDB is generated with version X of file t.v, and then another UCDB
is generated with version Y of file t.v, it doesn't make sense to
merge the source-based coverage metrics in those two UCDB's. 
This kind of checking is known as design unit signature checking.
<br>
The use of `ifdef to conditionally define code is a cause of legitimate
differences between the design source in two different UCDB's.  In order
to work around The simulator's DU signature check, you can use the <b>-ignoredusig</b>
option with vcover merge.
<br>
You should not use <b>-ignoredusig</b> lightly, without validating that the
differences in source code are OK.  Mis-use of <b>-ignoredusig</b> can lead to
very confusing coverage results, such as reports of branches on lines
with no branch, or reports of statements in areas that are commented out, etc.
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Fixed the possibility of a vsim crash when code coverage is on and a SystemVerilog
generate block contains an instance which is inlined. For the moment
we are inhibiting inlining of the instance within the generate block.
A full repair will not be possible in the 6.4x release sequence, but
will be included in a later release.
</li>
<li>
The GUI incorrectly highlighted portions of text when multiple Verilog statements were found on a single line of source.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="generaldefects"></a><b>General Defects Repaired in 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
The string "(null)" appears in the transcript when some SignalSpy errors are suppressed. This issue has been resolved.</li>
<li>
vcover could crash when merging UCDB files for certain VHDL designs. This has been corrected.
</li>
<li>
Collapsed dumpport values for busses could sometimes be reversed.  This has been fixed.
 </li>
<li>
Attempting to add wave, list or log a VlTypedef would cause a crash.</li>
<li>
The Verilog API method for transaction recording, $begin_transaction(), failed to handle its "begin_time" parameter correctly.  The parameter was treated as if it were a 32-bit integer time.  This has been corrected.</li>
<li>
For the -vcdstim feature, ascending order busses (i.e. 0 to 31) could sometimes be reversed in the resulting vcdstim resimulation.</li>

On Windows platform, if breakpoint is set on a SystemC object destructor, Debugger sometimes crashes while quitting simulation. This crash can be avoided by setting env variable SC_NO_LIB_UNLOAD, which will prevent unloading of the shared library.</li>
<li>
The simulator will hang if it tries to create a WLF file while running
on a Linux 64-bit operating system from a working directory which does
not support large files. One common instance of this is executing an
<b>add wave</b> command, when the working directory was created under an
older 32-bit Linux OS.
<br>
This is a Linux operating system bug and cannot be fixed by the
simulator.
<br>
A workaround for release 6.3 and above is to execute the simulator
with command line option <b>-wlfnolock</b>.

</li>
<li>
The stack unwinder on the linux_x86_64 OS is unreliable.  The unwinder is the fundamental facility provided by the OS for sampling where program execution is at.  The unwinder is necessary for gathering performance data.  This is a known issue with this specific OS and is why performance data will be incorrect or non-existent on this platform.  </li>
<li>
Users should be mindful of enabling both performance profiling and memory profiling at the same time.  Memory profiling requires much overhead process, and it can skew the results of the performance profiling data.</li>
<li>
On certain (RedHat) Linux Operating System versions the "-restore" feature
occasionally fails. This is due to the memory allocation security (anti-hacking) feature of Linux. RedHat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have this security feature. In these Linux releases two consecutive program invocations do not get the same memory allocation foot-print. For the "-restore" feature the simulator relies on having the same memory allocation foot-print. Users are advised to re-try this feature a few times as on average 3 out of 5 attempts are successful. In recent Linux versions, an override for this anti-hacking feature is provided. Please use it at your own discretion. </li>
<li>
In code coverage, there is no way to exclude a condition or expression table
row for the case of more than one table on a line and the table in question
is not the first table on the line.</li>
<li>
Support of debugging C code during a quit command was disabled on Windows. The corresponding C Debug command <b>cdbg stop_on_quit</b> was also disabled on Windows.
</li>
<li>
Specparams can be learned during the learn flow, but cannot be found on consumption. The workaround is to use full +acc deoptimization.</li>
<li>
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5 platform, If SIGSEGV signal occurs during the simulation and if CDEBUG is on, C-debugger traps the signal, and when continued, vsim gets terminated right away, instead of exiting with proper error status.</li>
<li>
For viewing events in Expanded Time in the List window, use the <b>configure list</b> command with the <b>-delta events</b> option.  <b>events</b> is added to the <b>all</b>, <b>collapse</b>, and <b>none</b> options for the <b>-delta</b> argument.  These options control the details shown in the List window and in writing list files.  This was documented incorrectly in the "Expanded Time Viewing in the List Window" section of the "Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.

The <b>write list -events</b> command serves a different purpose (which has not changed) and is NOT used to control Expanded Time viewing in List window.
</li>
<li>
The <b>examine</b>, <b>searchlog</b>, and <b>seetime</b> commands have NOT been enhanced
for use with Expanded Time.  This was documented incorrectly in the
"Expanded Time Viewing with examine and Other Commands" section of the
"Waveform Analysis" chapter of the User's Manual.
</li>
<li>
If you have code coverage on in VHDL and get the following sort of warning:<br>
# Loading mypackage(body) <br>
# Internal Warning in process_sub: failed to find local inlined subprogram 
called in pkg<br>
#     (mypackage ); flags 7 filenum 0 lineno 241 tokno 2<br>
#     Disabling code coverage for this inlined subprogram<br>
Then add the <b>-noFunctionInline</b> option to <b>vcom</b> for that package, 
or reorder the subprograms in the package body to be defined before they are used.</li>
<li>
Code coverage is now giving results for SystemVerilog nested modules, 
interfaces and program blocks. One remaining issue is that if a nested
module has more than one instance, only one of the instances will show
code coverage data, and the data therein will be the sum of all the
instances of that module. This will be improved in a later release.</li>
<li>
The vpiPorts iteration on vpiEnumNet, vpiIntegerNet, and vpiStructNet VPI objects has been disabled as it was incomplete and unsafe to use.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="productchanges"></a><b>Product Changes to 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
In previous versions of the simulator, a random seed was sometimes assigned to processes created for non-blocking-assignments, and this could affect random-stability, depending on optimizations that were in effect.  In 6.5, this is no longer the case; but it may result in different results involving randomization from 6.4x.
</li>
<li>
FSM recognition reporting in the coverage FSM flow has been made consistent with the FSMDEBUG flow. Both flows will only dump the number of FSMs detected by default. The <b>-fsmverbose</b> option can be used to display FSM RECOGNITION INFO, if required.
</li>
<li>
The default keyboard shortcuts for the cut/copy/paste operations have been changed to match the Windows standard of Control-X/C/V respectively. A new preference setting (Main/PCEditBindingsOnUnix) category has been added to control this. Note, any opened text windows at the time the preference is changed will not see the change until the next time the GUI is started.
</li>
<li>
A new search capability has been added for all windows that previously supported use of the Contains toolbar and/or the "Edit > Find..." menu. This new "Search Bar" will appear along the bottom edge of the window it's being used from. It completely replaces the old Contains toolbar and individual Find dialog boxes. For those windows that support both filtering and finding, the mode for the Search Bar would need to be set accordingly (the last selected mode for the Search Bar is remembered between sessions). The various ways of choosing the mode are:
<ul>
<li>use Control+M while the Search Bar has the keyboard focus
<li>select the mode from the Search Bar's menu (located on icon at far left)
<li>click the label text which indicates the current mode
</ul>
<br>
The current mode of the Search Bar is displayed as a text label to the left of the type-in field, as well as by the icon located at the left edge of the type-in area.

The main benefit of having the filtering functionality within the Search Bars is that each window now has its own unique type-in field as opposed to having to share the common Contains toolbar. The latter could lead to confusion over what is shown in the toolbar and the filtered content of the windows. There is also a simple history mechanism to allow saving search strings for later use. The keyboard shortcuts to support this are:
<ul>
<li>Control+S -- save current search text into history list
<li>Control+P -- retrieve previous search text
<li>Control+N -- retrieve next search text
</ul>
</li>
<li>
You must now change the encoding of your character representations with the <b>encoding system</b> command, where the syntax is:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encoding system &lt;encoding_name>
</code>
To obtain a complete list of &lt;encoding_name> options, use the <b>encoding names</b> command with no arguments.

Previously you could perform this action with the View > Encoding menu, which has been removed.
</li>
<li>
The VPI compatibility for this release defaults to the 2009 IEEE 1800 standard. This introduces, among other things, new VPI types for packed arrays of struct nets and struct variables. Normative files vpi_user.h, sv_vpi_user.h and vpi_compatibility.h are supplied with the latest known standardized contents. Users should however be aware that at the time of release the IEEE 1800-2009 was not complete.</li>
<li>
Event order differences between an optimized and unoptimized design have been reduced with this release. Specifically, event propagation through Verilog zero-delay continuous assignment and primitive networks has been changed such that optimizations involving these networks are much less likely to result in behavioral differences. However, note that a design depending on the old event ordering may not behave the same with this release. Both, the unoptimized and optimized behavior may change, but should match each other more closely. Ideally, "races" should be removed from the design, but, if desired, the user may revert back to the old event ordering by specifying the <b>-noimmedca</b> vsim option or by setting the following line in the <i>modelsim.ini</i> file:<br>
<code>
ImmediateContinuousAssign = 0
</code>
</li>
<li>
Code coverage information is no longer saved under design units in UCDB files. Instead, code coverage data for design units are constructed on-the-fly when a UCDB file is opened in IN_MEMORY mode. The information is constructed by merging all code coverage data from instances in the UCDB into the corresponding design unit. This has two main implications for UCDB API users:
<ol>
<li>Using APIs to create code coverage data under design units is not allowed anymore and the API calls will error out.</li>
<li>Opening UCDB files in read-streaming mode will not generate callbacks under design units since there is no code coverage data anymore.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The PrefMain(ShowFilePane) preference is now obsolete. The Files pane will follow current layout as do all other windows.</li>
<li>
The <b>view *</b> command is now obsolete.  The argument "*" will be ignored with no note warning or error.  A window name or window name prefix must be supplied in order to open or configure any windows.
</li>
<li>
When a non-existent entry of an associative array is read, a default value is returned.  We now re-initialize that value each time, in case the user modified it.  The exception is if the user set an explicit default value.<br>
For example:<br>
<code>
integer bar[integer][$];  // Assoc. array of queues.
<br>task execute();
<br>// Below, bar[2] doesn't exist, so we return the default value,
<br>// an empty queue.  The user is pushing 777 onto it.
<br>bar[2].push_back(777);
<br><br>
// Referencing bar[2] again now returns an empty queue.  In previous
<br>// versions, we returned {777}.  The $display now prints 'x'.
<br>$display ("bar [2][0]    = %0d", bar[2][0]);
</code> 
</li>
<li>
Some changes have been made to toggle coverage specific vsim command-line options.
<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>-togglevlogints</b> option has been removed as SystemVerilog integer types are now supported for toggle coverage by default.
<li>The following vsim command-line options have been changed as they were inconsistent with our convention.
<ul>
<li>-togglenoints       CHANGED TO   -notoggleints
<li>-togglenovlogints   CHANGED TO   -notogglevlogints
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We now treat a slice of a string as a string. This seems obvious, but it is not described anywhere in the LRM. The following is now supported:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string line = "Hello there";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string targ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial targ = line[0:5];
</code>
</li>
<li>
The option <b>-fsmdebug</b> has been deprecated. A new letter code 'f' has been added to <b>+acc</b> to enable FSM detection and debugging. This also makes it possible to have module and instance bases selection with FSM debug. +acc without any letter code with automatically enable +acc=f.
</li>
<li>
Conditional timing check expressions are displayed as they appear in the HDL description.  In the past equivalent conditions were displayed.  For example:<br>
<code> 
  &&& (cond === 0)
</code>
<br>
was dispayed as
<br>
<code>
  &&& (~cond)
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some cases the <b>-vmake</b> flag will be required to correctly capture Verilog source file dependencies.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h4>
<p><a NAME="newfeatures"></a><b>New Features Added to 6.5</b>
<ul>
<li>
Non-blocking-assignments to SystemVerilog expressions, such as a field within a struct, or an element of an unpacked array, are now optimized for improved performance.</li>
<li>
The <b>bp</b> command has been enhanced to accept multiple <b>-inst</b> options. This feature can be used to set multiple instance-path conditions on a single breakpoint. Also, the <b>bp</b> command can now be issued on the same breakpoint with different <b>-inst</b> option arguments. Default behavior is to override earlier breakpoint condition with the new one. New <b>-appendinst</b> option has been added. This option can be used to change the default behavior, and append the new instance-path condition to the earlier condition. This feature is supported for both HDL and C breakpoints.
</li>
<li>
Coverage commands now support handling datasetName:/path when using command line, previously coverage commands only worked on the current dataset.
Now coverage commands allow specifying which dataset to work on if multiple datasets are opened, if no dataset is specified on the command line the current dataset is used by default.
Only one datasetName per command invocation is supported.
</li>
<li>
Support for Mentor Dynamic Extensions has been added to SCV. These extensions will add support for the following:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Named constraints
<li>Dynamic enabling and disabling of named constraints
<li>Support for constrained randomization of std::vector<T> data type
<li>Support for Randomly Sized "Fixed-Max" Arrays
</ul></li>
<li>
The vmap <b>-del</b> command has been enhanced to support multiple library mappings.  This way, more then one library mapping may be deleted with a single command invocation.
</li>
<li>
The Wave/List Signal Search functionality has been enhanced to allow specifying an end time for the search. When an end is specified, the search will return the number of matched events within the search region. The <b>searchlog</b> command has also been enhanced to add a new option named <b>-endtime</b> which will also limit the search to finding only those matches between the start and end times.
</li>
<li>
Code coverage pragmas have been enhanced to support selectively turning coverage off and on for the following:
<ul>
<li>specific expressions and conditions in a line of source code, based on their expressions/condition numbers.
<li>specific rows from the FEC/UDP truth tables. <b>-feccondrow</b>, <b>-fecexprrow</b>, <b>-condrow</b> and <b>-exprrow</b> option have been added to the <b>-item</b> option of code coverage pragmas to facilitate this support.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Toggle coverage has been enhanced to support the following SystemVerilog types:
<ul>
<li>structures
<li>packed unions
<li>fixed-size multi-d arrays
<li>real
</ul></li>
<li>
A new option <b>-togglevlogenumbits</b> has been added in vsim to support 'customized linearization' of SystemVerilog enums. When this option is in effect, SystemVerilog enums are treated as reg vectors (considering the size of the reg-vector to be the size of the base type of enum) for toggle coverage and counts are be kept for each bit.
</li>
<li>
Support for SETUPHOLD added to <b>tcheck_set</b> and <b>tcheck_status</b> commands.
</li>
<li>
The Tcl foreach command now supports iterating over multi-dimension, dynamic and associative arrays, For example:<br>
<ul>int <b>arr[2][ ][classX]</b>;<br>
foreach (arr[i,j,k]) begin<br>
<ul>...</ul>
end</ul>
</li>
<li>
The <code>export</code> declaration is now supported in SystemVerilog packages.</li>
<li>
The new PSL replicator construct "for" is now supported in Modelsim and Questa.</li>
<li>
Added a run-time warning message for out of bounds bit-selects in initial blocks. It is suppressable using <b>+nowarnBSOB</b> on the vsim command line.
</li>
<li>
Environment variable NoAutoSDFCompile now can be used to disable automatic SDF compiling for flows that support it.</li>
<li>
The learn feature (as present in Verilog PLI/VPI) has been incorporated into the FLI functions.<br>
Instances (as in regions), signals, ports and variables information are learnt (dumped) into the OCF (acc and ocm) files in an incremental flow with <b>-learn</b> flag.<br>
During later optimized runs, these files can be used used for optimization control in vsim by specifying any one of these files:<br>
<code>
-voptargs="-f file_path"<br>
-voptargs="-ocf file_path"<br>
-voptargs="-ocf file_path"<br>
</code>
These flags can also be used directly with vopt.<br>
The optimizer preserves the access to the objects/region specified in the files. 
</li>
<li>
The simulator supports "unpacked array concatenation" as defined in Section 10.10 of the LRM.
</li>
<li>
The Dataflow window can compute and display all paths from one net to another.  This analysis can be accessed via either:<ul>
<li>"Point to Point" in the dataflow popup menu.  Two nets need to be selected before issuing the command. <ul> <li>Select the first (source) with a mouse click.  <li>Select the second (destination) with a SHIFT-mouse click.  <li>Then execute the "Point to Point" command from the popup menu.</ul>
<li><b>add data -connect &lt;source net&gt;  &lt;destination net&gt;</b> command. 
</ul>
<br>
To display these paths, the dataflow widget is put into greymode--that is, all components and nets are shown in grey.  Then, the source net is highlighted in yellow, intermediate processes and nets are orange and the terminal net is colored red.  In order to return to regular dataflow display, use the "Erase Highlight" popup menu pick.
<br>
<br>
If there are too many processes in the paths from source to destination, the analysis attempts to provide a single path.  The threshold used is the value of "p2plimit" in the dataflow section of Preferences.  The default value is 400.
</li>
<li>
The ATV window has been enhanced to include panes which show the values of the Design Objects in the assertion expression at the times the expression is evaluated.</li>
<li>
The Verification Management windows, browser and tracker, now can save and load their column layouts and filter information via the Export and Import menu. This information used to be saved automatically in the .modelsim file only. Now the user can also use Export and Import through the GUI with the filename they wish and this information is not embedded with other users information as in the .modelsim file. This feature helps the column layout and filter information to be easily used among different users.
</li>
<li>
A new argument <b>-testextract</b> for coverage reporting commands has been added to facilitate the generation of test specific results. This applies to UCDB files generated by a test-associated merge only. It can be used either from VIEWCOV mode using the <b>coverage report</b> command, or from the stand-alone vcover utility. Both commands accept the argument in this form:<br>
<code>coverage/vcover report [-testextract &lt test_name_or_pattern &gt]</code>
<br>
The user can specify multiple <b>testextract</b> arguments in the same invocation to combine results from multiple tests. This applies to reports generated in plain text and XML formats only, HTML reports are not supported. Two changes to the report format happen when using the new argument. A header line appears at the top of the report listing test name(s) used to generate the report. Another change is that the word "hit" will show up in place of the count number. This is due to the fact that UCDB files store only the aggregated coverage counts from all tests, and test-specific numbers cannot be reproduced.
</li>
<li>
Two new switches have been added to the <b>view</b> command, <b>-names</b> and <b>-aliases</b>.  The <b>-names</b> switch will list all the valid window names that may be used with the <b>view</b> command.  The <b>-aliases</b> switch will list all the alternative names, for example "testbrowser" which is an alias for "browser". (Aliases are used for backward compatibility when window names have changed from previous releases.)
</li>
<li>
The Wave window now supports zooming using the Control-Key + Mouse Wheel. This feature is similar to the use of the Mouse Wheel in the Dataflow, Schematic, and FSM viewers.</li>
<li>
The Wave window has a new short-cut key: Control-G which will perform auto-grouping of the selected signals in the window.  The signals are placed in groups based on the parent context path of the signals.  In other words they are grouped by region.  The group name is made further unique by appending a unique group name, e.g. "Group3", based on the value of the user preference PrefWave(GroupName).  If the preference is blank (""), then this unique label is not appended to the parent instance path for the group label.

<p>The Control-G shortcut can be used immediately following a Drag-n-Drop operation since the newly added signals are already selected. If a group already exist for a given region, any new signals that are auto-grouped with Control-G will be added to the existing group.</li>
<li>
The FSM viewer now supports an option to display the condition expressions for each transition.</li>
<li>
The Object window's popup menu now has a "Goto Driver" item that provides the same functionality that is available within the Source windows.</li>
<li>
Support has been added for VHDL external names in 6.5.  To access this feature
the compiler switch <b>-2008</b> needs to be used on the vcom command.  Currently
only external names to other VHDL objects are supported.  External names to constants work can currently only target generics not declared constants.
</li>
<li>
The Source window now supports Hyperlinked navigation. The source code is visualized in a hyperlinked way which enables the user to jump from the usage of an object to its declaration. The initial phase of this feature supports the current operations:
<ul>
<li>Jump from the usage of a signal, parameter, macro or a variable to its declaration.
<li>Jump from a module declaration to its instantiation and vice versa.
<li>Navigate back and forth between visited source files.
</ul></li>
<li>
A new modelsim.ini variable "CodeLinkAutoLoad" is added in [vsim] section that is 0 by default.  When this variable is set to 1, the contents of $CODELINK_HOME/sim/ms.cmd file, if present, are added to the vsim command-line.  When CodeLinkAutoLoad is set to 1 and the environment variable CODELINK_HOME is not set, a warning is issued.

</li>
<li>
VHDL package sharing at the SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary has been enhanced to support VHDL constants of all types that are currently supported at the SystemVerilog-VHDL mixed-language boundary.
</li>
<li>
Mixed language support of VHDL instantiation of Verilog modules having bidirectional pass switches (tran primitives) internally connected to their ports has been improved. Full bidirectional operation is now supported if the following requirements are met:<br>
<ul>
<li>The Verilog port is declared with mode "inout".
<li>The connected VHDL signal is of type or subtype "std_logic".
<li>The connected port hierarchy above the VHDL signal does not cross any other mixed language boundaries, and the top-level signal is also of type or subtype "std_logic".
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Added support for automatically preserving HDL targets of SystemC SignalSpy/control_foreign_signal/observe_foreign_signal/scv_connect calls in vopt.</li>
<li>
Added support for hierarchical references in actual expressions while binding to VHDL targets using the SystemVerilog bind construct. Only hierarchical references that terminate in a VHDL scope are supported.
</li>
<li>
Added a new system function $get_initial_random_seed. The $get_initial_random_seed function has no arguments and returns the integer value of the initial random seed, as specified via the "Sv_Seed" modelsim.ini variable or by using the <b>-sv_seed</b> vsim command-line option.
</li>
<li>
Some VHDL-2008 features are supported. These features can be accessed by using
the vcom command line option <b>-2008</b>. The temporary command line option <b>-200X_DRAFT</b> is no longer supported. For a complete description of supported features see the
technote "vhdl2008.note".
</li>
<li>
Encryption of VHDL source files is now supported. For details see technote
"vhdl_encryption.note".</li>
<li>
A new zoom capability has been added for Wave windows that allows setting the zoom range of all currently opened Wave windows to match that of the active Wave window. New menu items have been added as well as a new button in the "Zoom" toolbar. This new capability can be used via the "M" keyboard short in Wave windows.
</li>
<li>
The icons related to UCDB files in the Verification Browser have been upgraded.
The base U and M icons are still present, but they now contain adornments that
express additional information about the UCDB files associated with those icons.
If a 'p' is present in the upper right area of the icon, that means the UCDB
file contains a Verification Plan.   If a U icon contains a 'p', that means
the UCDB file <B>only</B> contains a Verification Plan.
The M icons now have numbers on the lower right, which indicate the type
of merge that was performed to create the UCDB file:

<OL>
<LI>indicates a -totals merge.</LI>
<LI>indicates a -testassociated merge.</LI>
</OL></li>
<li>
The code coverage icons displayed in the Hits columns of the Source window have been updated to show a finer granularity of information. There are now three basic kinds of icon in the Hits column: Exclusion, Missed Coverage, and Checkmark.
<br><p>
The exclusion icons are based on a large green E graphic. The icons potentially contain other, smaller graphics that convey further information about the line's coverage status. If any exclusion is present on a line, an Exclusion icon will be displayed, and the Missed and Checkmark icons will not be displayed. The Exclusion icons appear in the following priority order:
<OL>
<LI>E-with-red-x - some items are excluded; some unexcluded items have missed coverage</LI>
<LI>E-with-orange-asterisk - some or all items excluded; some excluded items are hit</LI>
<LI>E-with-green-checkmark - some items are excluded; all unexcluded items are hit</LI>
<LI>E - every single item on the line is excluded; none are hit</LI>
</OL>
<br><p>
The Missed Coverage icons have the next highest priority after the Exclusion icons. That means they will only be displayed if there are no Exclusions applied to the current line.  The following Missed Coverage icons are available:
<OL>
<LI>X - More than one kind of coverage on the line was missed</LI>
<LI>X-with-s - One or more statements on the line were missed</LI>
<LI>X-with-b - One or more branches on the line were missed</LI>
<LI>X-with-c - One or more conditions on the line were missed</LI>
<LI>X-with-e - One or more expressions on the line were missed</LI>
</OL>
<br><p>
Finally, if there are no exclusions on a line, and no Missed Coverage, then a big green checkmark icon is displayed.




</li>
<li>
When using the File > Open method to open a WLF log file, the contained signals were automatically added into a wave window. A new Wave window preference has been added to control whether this "auto add" is done. The setting is accessed in the Preferences dialog, on the "By Name" page, in the "Wave" section. The name of the setting is "OpenLogAutoAddWave".</li>
<li>
virtual interface elements are now supported in Covergroup (i.e. they can be used in coverpoint expression, bin iff expression, sample event, and option assignment). This was not allowed per IEEE 1800-2008 LRM.

</li>
