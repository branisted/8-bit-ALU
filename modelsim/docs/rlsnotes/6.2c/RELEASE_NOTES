   Key Information
     * The automatic invocation of the design-wide performance optimization
       tool "vopt" has been enabled. Upon invocation, the simulator determines
       if vopt has been run on the top-level module(s) you supplied; if not,
       the simulator invokes vopt and outputs a message similar to:
       # ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized...
       The optimization step will improve run time performance and affect the
       visibility of objects in the design. To enable debug visibility it is
       recommended you add additional options to vopt on the vsim invocation
       via the -voptargs argument. For example: vsim -voptargs="+acc" which
       enables  full  debug access to objects in the optimized design. To
       understand the full usage of +acc and -voptargs, please refer to the
       chapter "Optimizing Designs with vopt" in the User's Manual for more
       information.
       If required you may obtain the previous behavior of vsim, where it does
       not perform performance optimizations, by setting the modelsim.ini
       variable "VoptFlow" to 0 (zero). An alternative to setting VoptFlow to
       zero, where interactive debug compile throughput is required you can use
       the -novopt option on the vsim and compilation command line (vcom/vlog).
     * The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
       The support includes the following platforms:
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under
       the section Supported platforms.
     * The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.3 release:
          + HPUX Platforms - hp700, hppa64
          + AIX Platforms - rs6000, rs64
       The following platforms are discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
          + Windows 98
          + Windows ME
          + Windows NT 4.0
          + Solaris 2.6
          + Solaris 7
          + AIX 4.3
     * Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support
       includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.
        Solaris 10 has the following limitations:
          + In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between
            20ms  and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error
            message, "Too few samples." To workaround this problem, add the
            following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:
            set hires_tick=1
            This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time
            will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and
            will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum
            sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris
            releases.
          + In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the
            system  and  produce  a  messages  like "nfs server array not
            responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR
            6296698.
          + In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any PLI/FLI/DPI using g7 will
            break under Solaris 10.
     * The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.
          + The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible
            processors  running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat
            Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The
            profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit
            simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used
            concurrently on these systems.
          + RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported.
     * You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from
       6.1x  or  earlier  release versions. See "Regenerating your design
       libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your
       models.
     * Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any .pdf file
       contained in version 5.5c or greater.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the 5.7 release.
       The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0. Please note that
       in  order  for  FLI/PLI shared libraries to be loaded and executed
       correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they must be compiled and linked
       on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only), attempts to
       link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft Visual C++ linker
       version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to "Invalid file or disk
       full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 should
       be used.
     * Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress
       format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is
       supported. Therefore, we only read in compressed SDF files that are
       created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have
       a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * As of release 6.3, the linux versions of gcc 3.2.3 and 3.3 compilers
       will be replaced with version 4.0.2. This means that gcc 3.2.X and 3.3
       will  not  be supported or distributed as of release 6.3. Only the
       following versions will be supported in 6.3:
          + gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
          + gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
          + gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
          + gcc-3.3-sunos58
          + gcc-3.3-sunos59
          + gcc-3.3-sunos510
       In order to facilitate an easy transition for users, both gcc 3 and gcc
       4 will be supported and distributed in release 6.2. Since support for
       64-bit SystemC on linux_x86_64 was added in release 6.2, linux_x86_64
       will  only  be supported with the gcc 4.0.2 release. The following
       versions are supported in 6.2:
          + gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
          + gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
          + gcc-3.2.3-rhe21
          + gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
          + gcc-3.3-sunos58
          + gcc-3.3-sunos59
          + gcc-3.3-sunos510
       The  is no change on the hp700 platform and it will continue to be
       supported with aCC 3.45.
       Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions
       and C++ compiler versions.
       OS dependencies are slightly different for designs with and without
       SystemC content.
       Supported Operating Systems for designs with SystemC content:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater
          + RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater (simulation environment version 5.8b
            and greater)
          + Solaris 8, 9, and 10
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater
          + Win32 XP and 2000 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)
     * The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog
       and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the
            underlying C/C++ debugger. In order to run wdb successfully, you
            must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.
            Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during
            CDEBUG startup.
          + On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating
            shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'. This
            combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use gcc-3.2-aix51. The
            native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
       VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu in
            the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in
       existing code. There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the
       first is by using the -sv command line option and the second is by
       naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.
     * The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.
       The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat
       Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
          + 32-bit linux
          + 64-bit linux_x86_64
       FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an
       EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.
     * The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5;
       Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
       CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
       For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software being
       used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
       verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
       (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
       vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
       FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
       and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
       license  server  and  restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
       contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
       need to do anything.
     * SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit()
       task.
     * The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit"
       variable in the modelsim.ini file. By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.
       The  default  time  unit  in  SystemC  can  also  be set using the
       sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like
       sc_clock or sc_time is created.
     * vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar
       to the vsim command line options.
     * Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option has changed
       behavior somewhat. This primarily affects win32 and rs6000 users.
         1. You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename. That will be
            done for you automatically now.
         2. There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'" to the vsim
            -dpiexportobj command line.
       The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat files have been
       modified to show the correct flow now.
     * Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher
       will not run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).
       # Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled
       # version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library
       # was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make
       # sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.
     * The product documentation contains a new look and feel for this release.
       You will find links to the documentation in your Help dropdown menu. PDF
       documentation is available from the PDF Bookcase menu item and HTML
       documentation (if shipped with the product) is available from the Help &
       Manuals menu item.

     * This release includes a new dongle driver installer for Windows. The new
       dongle driver versions that will be installed are as follows:
          + Aladdin (FLEXID=9-) driver version 4.96
          + Dallas (FLEXID=8-) driver version 3.2.1.11
          + Sentinel (FLEXID=6-)/(FLEXID=7-) driver version 5.41
       The new dongle driver installer will install these drivers only if they
       are newer than the currently installed dongle drivers on your Windows
       system.
     * On linux_x86_64 platform, the default thread that implements SystemC
       co-routine thread has been changed to QuickThreads. Our tests show that
       QuickThreads has a better reliability than the OSCI-default PThread on
       linux_x86_64 and better performance in certain testcases. As a result
       QuickThreads becomes the default SystemC thread for all platforms that
       support SystemC.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * Accessing dynamic local variables from the Objects window caused a crash
       in certain cases. Dynamic locals will no longer appear in this window,
       now only static locals are displayed.
     * Selection of a non-active process in the Structure or Dataflow window in
       some cases required excessive time when the Active Process window was
       populated. An example of this scenario is immediately after elaboration
       but  before  the first run command and when many Verilog "initial"
       processes were scheduled. This operation now runs significantly faster.
     * If the -pslfile switch was used before the -cover switch on the vlog
       command line, there was no code coverage in vsim in vopt mode.
     * vsim silently ignored invalid switch options that began with -a, -k, or
       -0. If a valid switch starting with one of these letters or numbers was
       misspelled, the simulator did not report an error, nor was the switch
       recognized.
     * The option of specifying a dataset name for opening vsim in coverage
       view mode did not work correctly in 6.2b. Here is an example of the
       invoking vsim in coverage view mode:
       vsim -viewcov dsname=file.ucdb
     * The Library view did not update correctly when a change directory was
       performed, or when a project was closed or a new one opened. Some of the
       logical library mappings were incorrectly retained.
     * The add wave -divider command in some cases caused internal memory to
       become corrupt and subsequent commands behaved incorrectly or stopped
       working.
     * The coverage report did not show exclusions which were specified using
       line ranges.
     * Command completion for the coverage command was incorrect in vsim and
       viewcov modes.
     * Coverage exclude command doesn't update GUIs in viewcov mode.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * Design optimization failed in some cases when inlining modules with
       SystemVerilog var port connections.
     * Incorrect compilation errors resulted in certain cases for an assignment
       from a class object to a base type variable when the object type was
       derived from a base type through multiple parameterized class types.
     * Incorrect errors regarding the context of genvar use could be reported
       when optimizing a design containing generate for loops.
     * System functions $sscanf and $fscanf continued scan of their inputs even
       if no acceptable characters were found for a conversion specification.
       Scan is now terminated in this case.
     * The conversion specification "%f" in system functions $sscanf() and
       $fscanf()  sometimes  allowed conversion of an illegal sequence of
       characters.
     * Compiling two source files that declare the same module name in some
       cases resulted in the first file name being reported as the source of an
       error or warning detected while compiling the second file.
     * Under  certain conditions, the gate-level optimized cell evaluator
       ignored notifier register toggles fanning into always blocks.
     * When  the vsim command line options +multisource_int_delays and/or
       +transport_int_delays were specified with the vsim command line option
       -v2k_int_delays or compiled SDF files, in simulating a design that had
       nets with large fanin and fanout, the SDF load times were very long.
     * When +grp_ntc_outputs was specified for vlog and +multisource_int_delays
       or +transport_int_delays was specified for vsim, some simulations looped
       indefinitely.
     * Design optimization failed in certain cases of self-recursive module
       instantiations.
     * An error regarding "too many indices" resulted when indexing into a
       class property of a parameterized class where the type of the property
       was a type parameter which resolved to an array type.
     * When specializing a parameterized class, errors were not reported when
       specifying too many parameters, when associating to an incorrect name,
       or when providing multiple definitions of a parameter.
     * Calling a task (residing in an interface) through a virtual interface
       resulted in an erroneous error.
     * Elaboration warnings resulted when referencing a static property in an
       imported class where the class name and package name were the same.
     * Errors  resulted  when  parameterized  class  specializations were
       differentiated in source only by an enum type versus an integral type.
       Such specialized types were incorrectly treated as the same type.
     * Null  values,  "()",  in IOPATH and SETUPHOLD statements, were not
       correctly annotated to optimized cells.
     * SystemVerilog packages did not correctly scale time values according to
       the current `timescale directive or timeunit/timeprecision declarations.
     * An internal error in vlog occurred if a randsequence statement was
       specified within the body of an out-of-block class method.
     * Misleading  'Missing  connection for port ...' warnings could have
       occurred when a 'Too few port connections' situation existed and the
       code contained named port association. The number of 'Missing connection
       for port ...' warnings will now match the number of missing ports in the
       'Too few port connections' warning message.
     * When a SystemVerilog module containing a package import was optimized by
       vopt it would sometimes generate error messages like: ** INTERNAL ERROR:
       export_lookup() failed.
     * When compiling SystemVerilog code with -mfcu the command line switches
       following -mfcu were being ignored by vopt.

   PLI Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * PLI calls to acc_next_port failed in certain cases when accessing memory
       beyond the size of an internal data structure when accessing a bit net.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * A wait statement with a function call in the condition clause (i.e.,
       until condition) may not have executed correctly.
     * If a library, entity, and architecture had the same simple name and you
       tried to attribute the architecture, an error occurred. In this case the
       following error message was generated:
       ** Error: src/src_file.vhd(21): 'library_entity_architecture_name' is
       not in the specified attribute entity class. Possible ambiguous name.
     * In some cases an event on a slice of a port failed to trigger a process
       that was sensitive to that slice. As a result, incorrect simulation
       results occurred.
     * In  some  cases involving disconnection of a port, incorrect error
       messages were produced when the formal port was guarded and the actual
       port was not guarded.
     * When running vopt or vsim, if -L directives are present when optimzing
       the design, errors occurred if the library names conflicted with other
       VHDL identifiers. When this occurred error messages about the name being
       of the incorrect class were generated.
     * Using an alias to a subprogram declaration in a package header and then
       attempting to define the subprogram body corresponding to that alias is
       detected as compilation error.

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * The simulator crashed when accessing variables defined after a signal or
       port of resolved vector type.
     * The gcc utility mingw-gcc-3.3.1 generated a link error if the user had a
       MinGW  package  installed.  The error was due to the definition of
       md_startfile_prefix in the gcc specification file.
     * The libgcc.a library shipped with mingw-gcc-3.3.1 was built with debug
       symbols on. This increased the size of the DLLs created while using this
       utility.
     * The GUI crashed when a transaction attribute expansion in the Wave
       window resulted in the newly viewable attributes extending below the
       bottom visible part of the window.
     * A SystemC module instance declared using forward declaration might
       become undebuggable depending on the order of analysis of source files.

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * The error message:
       ** Error: (vsim-3171) Could not find machine code ...
       was  issued by vsim in situations where a module instantiates both
       Verilog modules containing instantiations of VHDL architectures, and
       direct instantiations of VHDL architectures. The VHDL architectures had
       to have been specialized, in that they contained generics inferred to be
       constants by vopt.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 6.2c
     * The vopt -o argument allowed characters in the name that caused vsim to
       be unable to simulate the result. Now only alphanumeric and underscore
       characters are allowed in the name.
     * vcd dummports failed to capture net values from the force command, force
       -freeze command, and the Verilog force statement.
     * vopt failed to find a library in some cases in which,
          + the physical library name contained upper case letters,
          + no library mapping was given,
          + the library name was specified using the -L or -Lf command line
            options.
     * The tool vcd2wlf rarely created incorrect results in the case where a
       scalar is an alias (same VCD id) with a member of a bus.
     * An erroneous out-of-bounds error could be reported during simulation on
       linux, linux_x86_64, or win32 platforms for operations (e.g. assignment)
       on character or byte-sized data.
     * Condition  and  expression  coverage  tables were not always built
       correctly. If an expression contained the subexpression (a = '1') and
       the subexpression (a = '0'), coverage required that both subexpressions
       be true at once. Now we descend into these relational subexpressions and
       discern that both use the variable "a". Also, subexpressions like (a and
       b) = '1' were not handled correctly. A side effect of this fix is that
       spurious warnings are generated when you have a relational expression
       involving an integer variable. That case will not be handled until the
       next release.

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 6.2c
     * dts0100351763 - Improve message for Named assertions still active at end
       of simulation.
     * dts0100346818 - Conditional assignment is not sensitive to some signal
       changes during simulation.
     * dts0100344136 - Crash from the simulator with SystemC after command "log
       -r /*".

   Product Changes to 6.2c
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 6.2c
     * The vsim shell command has added support for standard X11 application
       switches:
  -colormap new
  -display display spec
  -geometry geometry spec
  -name name
  -sync
  -visual visual
  --
       Where:
         1. -colormap new specifies that the window should have a new private
            colormap instead of using the default colormap for the screen
         2. display spec specifies the name of the display to use (e.g. :0)
         3. geometry spec specifies the size and location of the main window in
            the form WxH+X+Y
         4. name specifies the title to be displayed in the window, and as the
            name of the interpreter for send commands.
         5. visual specifies the visual to use for the window. Visual may have
            any of the forms: class depth, default, number, or best ?depth?.
              1. class depth is one of: directcolor, grayscale, greyscale,
                 pseudocolor,  staticcolor,  staticgray,  staticgrey,  or
                 truecolor, or a unique abbreviation. depth specifies how many
                 bits per pixel are needed for the visual
              2. default the default visual for the screen
              3. number specifies a visual X identifier
              4. best ?depth? choose the ``best possible'' visual
       Notes:
         1. Support of the -colormap and -visual options are dependent on what
            colormap and visuals options are supported by the X server.
         2. The -name option will only effect the application name used in the
            send command. The title is not effected.
     * SDF annotation support of setuphold and recrem timing checks using a
       combination of explicit condition arguments and implicit conditions on
       events were added.
     * When vlog is invoked with the -lint option, warnings will be displayed
       for enum type mismatches between the operands of binary comparison
       operators.
     * The project compileall command has been enhanced to print the set of
       compile commands without executing the compilations. This feature is
       enabled by using the -n option. For example:
       project compileall -n
     * The -recursive switch is added with vcover merge -du utility, to merge
       hierarchies below the given design unit. This -recursive switch is valid
       only when the -du switch is specified.
     * SystemC variables of user-defined types, user-defined channels and ports
       can now be debuggable using the custom debug interface. Use the custom
       debug   registration   macros   SC_MTI_REGISTER_CUSTOM_DEBUG   and
       SC_MTI_REGISTER_NAMED_CUSTOM_DEBUG for registering SystemC objects for
       custom debug. Refer to the section "Custom Debug Interface for Channels
       and Variables" in the User's Manual for more information.
