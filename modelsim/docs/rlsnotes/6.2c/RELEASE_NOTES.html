<p><a NAME="keyinfo"></a><b>Key Information</b>
<ul>
<li>
The automatic invocation of the design-wide performance optimization tool "vopt" has been enabled. Upon invocation, the simulator determines if vopt has been run on the top-level module(s) you supplied; if not, the simulator invokes vopt and outputs a message similar to: 
<br>
# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized... 
<br>
The optimization step will improve run time performance and affect the visibility of objects in the design. To enable debug visibility it is recommended you add additional options to vopt on the vsim invocation via the -voptargs argument.  For example: vsim <b>-voptargs</b>="+acc" which enables full debug access to objects in the optimized design. To understand the full usage of <b>+acc</b> and <b>-voptargs</b>, please refer to the chapter "Optimizing Designs with vopt" in the User's Manual for more information. 
<br>
If required you may obtain the previous behavior of vsim, where it does not perform performance optimizations, by setting the modelsim.ini variable "VoptFlow" to 0 (zero). An alternative to setting VoptFlow to zero, where interactive debug compile throughput is required you can use the <b>-novopt</b> option on the vsim and compilation command line (vcom/vlog).</li>
<li>
The RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is supported as of the 6.1b release.
<br>
The support includes the following platforms:
<br>
<ul>
<li>32-bit linux
<li>64-bit linux_x86_64 
</ul>
<p>
For a complete list of supported platforms see the Install Guide under the section Supported platforms.</li>
<li>
The following platforms will be discontinued as of the 6.3 release:
<ul>
<li>HPUX Platforms - hp700, hppa64
<li>AIX Platforms - rs6000, rs64
</ul>
The following platforms are discontinued as of the 6.2 release:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Windows 98
<li>Windows ME
<li>Windows NT 4.0
<li>Solaris 2.6
<li>Solaris 7
<li>AIX 4.3
</ul></li>
<li>
Solaris OS 10 is supported as of the 6.1a release. Solaris OS 10 support includes SystemC. However, cdebug is not supported.

<UL>Solaris 10 has the following limitations:

<LI>In the OS, vt alarm is producing irregular and random beats between 20ms and 100ms. As a result, the profiler produces the error message, "Too few samples."  To workaround this problem, add the following line to the file /etc/system and reboot the system:<br>
set hires_tick=1<br>
This will produce consistent sample times. The minimum sample time will be 20ms. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6290459 and will be fixed in a coming kernel patch. With the patch, the minimum sample time will be approximately 10ms, as in previous Solaris releases.
<LI>In rare cases, simulations using sockets via the FLI may hang the system and produce a messages like "nfs server array not responding" may be produced. This problem has been filed as Sun CR 6296698.
<LI>In Solaris 10, g7 is always reserved. Any  PLI/FLI/DPI using g7 will break under Solaris 10.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The following platform changes are effective as of the 6.0 release.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The 64-bit simulator is supported on the AMD Opteron and compatible processors running 64-bit Linux (SuSE 9.0 (x86-64) or RedHat Enterprise Linux WS release 3) as the linux_x86_64 platform. The profiling feature is not supported in 64-bit mode. The 32-bit simulator for the linux platform may also be installed and used concurrently on these systems.
<LI>RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 are no longer supported. 
</UL>

</li>
<li>
You must recompile or refresh your models if you are moving forward from 6.1x or  earlier release versions. See "Regenerating your design libraries" in the User's Manual for more information on refreshing your models.</li>
<li>
Acrobat reader version 4.0 or greater must be used to read any
.pdf file contained in version 5.5c or greater.

</li>
<li>
The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the
5.7 release. The hp700 platform executables are built on HP-UX 11.0.
Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
loaded and executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
</li>
<li>
Beginning with the 5.6 release (on Windows platforms only),
attempts to link in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
Visual C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
"Invalid file or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.

</li>
<li>
Beginning in the 5.8 release, SDF files compressed in the Unix compress format (.Z) are no longer supported, but the GNU zip format (.gz)is supported.  Therefore, we only read in compressed SDF files that are created with the GNU zip (gzip) extension. A file is not require to have a .gz extension, but it will error on files that have a .Z extension.</li>
<li>
As of release 6.3, the linux versions of gcc 3.2.3 and 3.3 compilers will be replaced with version 4.0.2. This means that gcc 3.2.X and 3.3 will not be supported or distributed as of release 6.3. Only the following versions will be supported in 6.3:
<ul>
<li>gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
<li>gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
<li>gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos58
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos59
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos510
</ul>
In order to facilitate an easy transition for users, both gcc 3 and gcc 4 will be supported and distributed in release 6.2. Since support for 64-bit SystemC on linux_x86_64 was added in release 6.2, linux_x86_64 will only be supported with the gcc 4.0.2 release. The following versions are supported in 6.2:
<ul>
<li>gcc-3.3.1-mingw32
<li>gcc-4.0.2-linux_x86_64
<li>gcc-3.2.3-rhe21
<li>gcc-4.0.2-rhe21
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos58
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos59
<li>gcc-3.3-sunos510
</ul>
The is no change on the hp700 platform and it will continue to be supported with aCC 3.45.<br>

Support of SystemC has dependencies on both operating system versions and C++ compiler versions.
<br>
OS dependencies are slightly different for designs with and without SystemC content.
<br>
Supported Operating Systems for designs with SystemC content:<br>
<ul>
<li>RedHat 7.3 and greater</li>
<li>RedHat EWS2.1/7.2 and greater (simulation environment version 5.8b and greater)</li>
<li>Solaris 8, 9, and 10</li>
<li>HP-UX 11.0 and greater</li>
<li>Win32 XP and 2000 (Simulation environment versions 6.0 and greater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LE product does not support VHDL. However, it does support Verilog and SystemC.</li>
<li>
CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>On HP-UX 11.0, the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program is used as the underlying C/C++ debugger.  In order to run wdb successfully, you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a superseding patch.  Without this patch installed, error messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
<LI>On rs6000, gdb-6.0 works with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when creating shared objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not 'gcc'.
This combination works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1  use gcc-3.2-aix51.
The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible with gdb-6.0.
</UL>

</li>
<li>
The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987 to
VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:<br>
<UL>
<LI>select the appropriate
version from the compiler options menu in the GUI,<br>
<LI>invoke vcom using
switches <b>-87</b>, <b>-93</b>, or <b>-2002</b>, or<br>
<LI>set the VHDL93 variable in the [vcom] section of modelsim.ini.<BR>
Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;<br>
<LI>1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;<br>
<LI>2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.<br>
</UL>
</UL>
</li>
<li>
Although the vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they require new language keywords that may conflict with identifiers in existing code.  There are two ways to enable SystemVerilog features: the first is by using the <b>-sv</b> command line option and the second is by naming the source file with a ".sv" suffix.</li>
<li>
The EM64T platform is supported as of the 6.0b release.<BR>
The support includes EM64T machines loaded with Suse 9.1 OS or RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 3 OS and the following linux configurations.
<UL>
<LI>32-bit linux
<LI>64-bit linux_x86_64
</UL>
FlexLM v8.2a (which is currently shipped in 6.0x) is not supported on an EM64T machine loaded with Suse 9.1 OS.

</li>
<li>
The 6.1 release will use the following licensing versions: FLEXlm v9.5; Mentor Graphics Licensing MGLS v2004.2 and PCLS 2004.328.
<p>
CRITICAL LICENSING INFORMATION:
<p>
For this release of the product, the FLEXlm licensing software
being used is version 9.5. For floating licenses it will be necessary to
verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server
(i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions equal to or greater than 9.5. The
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be
FLEXlm version 9.5. If the current FLEXlm version of your vendor daemon
and lmgrd are less than 9.5 then it will be necessary to stop your
license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd
contained in this release. If you use node locked licenses you don't
need to do anything.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog Program blocks are now supported except for the $exit() task.</li>
<li>
The default time unit for SystemC can be set using the "ScTimeUnit" variable in the modelsim.ini file.  By default ScTimeUnit is set to 1 ns.  The default time unit in SystemC can also be set using the sc_set_default_time_unit() function before any time based object like sc_clock or sc_time is created.</li>
<li>
vlog,vcom and vopt command line options will be case sensitive similar to the vsim command line options.</li>
<li>
Starting in the 6.1 release, the vsim -dpiexportobj option
has changed behavior somewhat.  This primarily affects
win32 and rs6000 users.

<OL>
<LI>You shouldn't put an extension on the object filename.
   That will be done for you automatically now.</LI>

<LI>There is no longer a need to add "-c -do 'quit -f'"
   to the vsim -dpiexportobj command line.</LI>
</OL>
The examples/systemverilog/dpi/simple_calls runtest.bat
files have been modified to show the correct flow now.
</li>
<li>
Due to some bug fixes, some VHDL models compiled with 6.1b or higher will not
run under 6.1 and 6.1a. These models will generate the error:<br>
<code>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-3274) Empty built-in function pointer (511).<br>
# Either this version of vsim is not compatible with the compiled<br>
# version of the libraries that were loaded or a required shared library<br>
# was not loaded. Please recompile the libraries with -refresh or make<br>
# sure you specify the required shared library to vsim.<br>
</code></li>
<li>

<UL>
<LI>Aladdin (FLEXID=9-)  driver version 4.96
<LI>Dallas  (FLEXID=8-)  driver version 3.2.1.11 
<LI>Sentinel (FLEXID=6-)/(FLEXID=7-) driver version 5.41
</UL>

          </li>
<li>
On linux_x86_64 platform, the default thread that implements SystemC co-routine thread has been changed to QuickThreads. Our tests show that QuickThreads has a better reliability than the OSCI-default PThread on linux_x86_64 and better performance in certain testcases. As a result QuickThreads becomes the default SystemC thread for all platforms that support SystemC.


</li>
<li>The following lists the supported platforms:
   <ul>
   <li>win32aloem - Windows 2000, XP
   <li>sunos5aloem - Solaris 8, 9
   <li>hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
   <li>linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.

<p><a NAME="uidefects"></a><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 6.2c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Accessing dynamic local variables from the Objects window caused a crash in certain cases. Dynamic locals will no longer appear in this window, now only static locals are displayed.</li>
<li>
Selection of a non-active process in the Structure or Dataflow window in some cases required excessive time when the Active Process window was populated.  An example of this scenario is immediately after elaboration but before the first <b>run</b> command and when many Verilog "initial" processes were scheduled. This operation now runs significantly faster.</li>
<li>
If the <b>-pslfile</b> switch was used before the <b>-cover</b> switch on the vlog command line, there was no code coverage in vsim in vopt mode.</li>
<li>
vsim silently ignored invalid switch options that began with -a, -k, or -0.  If a valid switch starting with one of these letters or numbers was misspelled, the simulator did not report an error, nor was the switch recognized.</li>
<li>
The option of specifying a dataset name for opening vsim in coverage view mode
did not work correctly in 6.2b. Here is an example of the invoking vsim in coverage view mode:<br>
<code>
vsim -viewcov dsname=file.ucdb
</code></li>
<li>
The Library view did not update correctly when a change directory was performed, or when a project was closed or a new one opened. Some of the logical library mappings were incorrectly retained.</li>
<li>
The <b>add wave -divider</b> command in some cases caused internal memory to become corrupt and subsequent commands behaved incorrectly or stopped working.</li>
<li>
The coverage report did not show exclusions which were specified
using line ranges.</li>
<li>
Command completion for the <b>coverage</b> command was incorrect in vsim and viewcov modes.</li>
<li>
Coverage exclude command doesn't update GUIs in viewcov mode.</li>
</ul>

<p><a NAME="verilogdefects"></a><b>Verilog Defects Repaired in 6.2c</b>
<ul>
<li>
Design optimization failed in some cases when inlining modules with SystemVerilog var port connections.</li>
<li>
Incorrect compilation errors resulted in certain cases for an assignment from a class object to a base type variable when the object type was derived from a base type through multiple parameterized class types.</li>
<li>
Incorrect errors regarding the context of genvar use could be reported when optimizing a design containing generate for loops.</li>
<li>
System functions $sscanf and $fscanf continued scan of their inputs even if no acceptable characters were found for a conversion specification.  Scan is now terminated in this case.</li>
<li>
The conversion specification "%f" in system functions $sscanf()
and $fscanf() sometimes allowed conversion of an illegal
sequence of characters.</li>
<li>
Compiling two source files that declare the same module name in some cases resulted in the first file name being reported as the source of an error or warning detected while compiling the second file.</li>
<li>
Under certain conditions, the gate-level optimized cell evaluator ignored notifier register toggles fanning into always blocks.</li>
<li>
When the vsim command line options <b>+multisource_int_delays</b> and/or <b>+transport_int_delays</b> were specified with the vsim command line option <b>-v2k_int_delays</b> or compiled SDF files, in simulating a design that had nets with large fanin and fanout, the SDF load times were very long.
</li>
<li>
When <b>+grp_ntc_outputs</b> was specified for vlog and <b>+multisource_int_delays</b> or <b>+transport_int_delays</b> was specified for vsim, some simulations looped indefinitely.</li>
<li>
Design optimization failed in certain cases of self-recursive module instantiations.</li>
<li>
An error regarding "too many indices" resulted when indexing into a class property of a parameterized class where the type of the property was a type parameter which resolved to an array type.</li>
<li>
When specializing a parameterized class, errors were not reported when specifying too many parameters, when associating to an incorrect name, or when providing multiple definitions of a parameter.</li>
<li>
Calling a task (residing in an interface) through a virtual interface resulted in an erroneous error.</li>
<li>
Elaboration warnings resulted when referencing a static property in an imported class where the class name and package name were the same.</li>
<li>
Errors resulted when parameterized class specializations were differentiated in source only by an enum type versus an integral type.  Such specialized types were incorrectly treated as the same type.</li>
<li>
Null values, "()", in IOPATH and SETUPHOLD statements, were not correctly annotated to optimized cells.</li>
<li>
SystemVerilog packages did not correctly scale time values according to the current `timescale directive or timeunit/timeprecision declarations.</li>
<li>
An internal error in vlog occurred if a randsequence statement was specified within the body of an out-of-block class method.</li>
<li>
Misleading 'Missing connection for port ...' warnings could have occurred when a 'Too few port connections' situation existed and the code contained named port association.  The number of 'Missing connection for port ...' warnings will now match the number of missing ports in the 'Too few port connections' warning message.</li>
<li>
When a SystemVerilog module containing a package import was optimized by vopt it would sometimes generate error messages like:

    ** INTERNAL ERROR: export_lookup() failed.</li>
<li>
When compiling SystemVerilog code with -mfcu the command line switches following -mfcu were being ignored by vopt.</li>

A wait statement with a function call in the condition clause (i.e., until condition) may not have executed correctly.</li>
<li>
If a library, entity, and architecture had the same simple name and you
tried to attribute the architecture, an error occurred. In this case the following error message was generated:<br>
<code>
** Error: src/src_file.vhd(21): 'library_entity_architecture_name' is not in the specified attribute entity class. Possible ambiguous name.
</code>
</li>
<li>
In some cases an event on a slice of a port failed to trigger a process that
was sensitive to that slice. As a result, incorrect simulation results occurred.</li>
<li>
In some cases involving disconnection of a port, incorrect error messages were
produced when the formal port was guarded and the actual port was not guarded.</li>
<li>
When running vopt or vsim, if -L directives are present when optimzing the design,
errors occurred if the library names conflicted with other VHDL identifiers. When
this occurred error messages about the name being of the incorrect class were
generated.</li>
<li>
Using an alias to a subprogram declaration in a package header and then attempting to define the subprogram body corresponding to that alias is detected as compilation error.</li>

The error message:<br>
<code>
** Error: (vsim-3171) Could not find machine code ...
</code>
<br>
was issued by vsim in situations where a module instantiates both Verilog modules containing instantiations of VHDL architectures, and direct instantiations of VHDL architectures. The VHDL architectures had to have been specialized, in that they contained generics inferred to be constants by vopt.</li>

<li>
The vopt <b>-o</b> argument allowed characters in the name that caused
vsim to be unable to simulate the result. Now only alphanumeric and
underscore characters are allowed in the name.</li>
<li>
vcd dummports failed to capture net values from the <b>force</b> command, <b>force -freeze</b> command, and the Verilog force statement.</li>
<li>
vopt failed to find a library in some cases in which,
<UL>
<LI>the physical library name contained upper case letters,
<LI>no library mapping was given,
<LI>the library name was specified using the <b>-L</b> or <b>-Lf</b> command line options.
</UL></li>
<li>
The tool vcd2wlf rarely created incorrect results in the case where a scalar is an alias (same VCD id) with a member of a bus.</li>
<li>
An erroneous out-of-bounds error could be reported during simulation on linux, linux_x86_64, or win32 platforms for operations (e.g. assignment) on character or byte-sized data.
</li>
<li>
Condition and expression coverage tables were not always built correctly.
If an expression contained the subexpression (a = '1') and the subexpression (a = '0'), coverage required that both subexpressions be true at once. Now we descend into these relational subexpressions and discern that both use the variable "a". Also, subexpressions like (a and b) = '1' were not handled correctly. A side effect of this fix is that spurious warnings are generated when you have a relational expression involving an integer variable. That case will not be handled until the next release.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The vsim shell command has added support for standard X11 application switches: <pre>
  -colormap <b>new</b>
  -display <i>display spec</i>
  -geometry <i>geometry spec</i>
  -name <i>name</i>
  -sync
  -visual <i>visual</i>
  --
</pre>
Where:<br>
<OL type="disc">
  <LI>-colormap <b>new</b> specifies that the window should have a new private colormap instead of using the default colormap for the screen
  <LI><i>display spec</i>  specifies the name of the display to use (e.g. :0)
  <LI><i>geometry spec</i>  specifies the size and location of the main window in the form <i>W</i><b>x</b><i>H</i><b>+</b><i>X</i><b>+</b><i>Y</i>
  <LI><i>name</i>  specifies the title to be displayed in the window, and as the name of the interpreter for send commands.
  <LI><i>visual</i>  specifies the visual to use for the window. Visual may have any of the forms: <i>class depth</i>, <b>default</b>, <i>number</i>, or <b>best</b> <i>?depth?</i>.
<OL type="circle">
    <LI><i>class depth</i> is one of: <b>directcolor</b>, <b>grayscale</b>, <b>greyscale</b>, <b>pseudocolor</b>, <b>staticcolor</b>, <b>staticgray</b>, <b>staticgrey</b>, or <b>truecolor</b>, or a unique abbreviation. <i>depth</i> specifies how many bits per pixel are needed for the visual
    <LI><b>default</b> the default visual for the screen
    <LI><i>number</i> specifies a visual X identifier
    <LI><b>best</b> <i>?depth?</i> choose the ``best possible'' visual
</OL>
</OL>
Notes: 
<ol>
<li>Support of the -colormap and -visual options are dependent on what colormap and visuals options are supported by the X server.
<li>The -name option will only effect the application name used in the send command.  The title is not effected.
</ol></li>
<li>
SDF annotation support of setuphold and recrem timing checks using a combination of explicit condition arguments and implicit conditions on events were added.</li>
<li>
When vlog is invoked with the <b>-lint</b> option, warnings will be displayed for enum type mismatches between the operands of binary comparison operators.</li>
<li>
The <b>project compileall</b> command has been enhanced to print the set of compile commands without executing the compilations.  This feature is enabled by using the <b>-n</b> option. For example:<br>
<code>
project compileall -n
</code></li>
<li>
The <b>-recursive</b> switch is added with vcover merge -du utility,
to merge hierarchies below the given design unit. This <b>-recursive</b> switch 
is valid only when the <b>-du</b> switch is specified.</li>
<li>
SystemC variables of user-defined types, user-defined channels and ports can now be debuggable using the custom debug interface. Use the custom debug registration macros SC_MTI_REGISTER_CUSTOM_DEBUG and SC_MTI_REGISTER_NAMED_CUSTOM_DEBUG for registering SystemC objects for custom debug. Refer to the section "Custom Debug Interface for Channels and Variables" in the User's Manual for more information.</li>
