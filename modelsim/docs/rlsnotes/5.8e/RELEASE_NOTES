   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.8e  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.8e release from
       5.7x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.8  release,  FLEXlm  licensing software is
       upgraded  to  version  8.2.  For  floating  licenses  it  will  be
       necessary  to  verify  that  the vendor daemon (i.e., modeltech or
       mgcld)  and  the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXlm versions
       equal  to  or  greater than 8.2. The vendor daemons and lmgrd that
       are  shipped  with this release will be FLEXlm version 8.2. If the
       current  FLEXlm  version  of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 8.2, then you need to stop your license server and restart it
       using  the  vendor  daemon and lmgrd contained in this release. If
       you use nodelocked licenses you don't need to do anything.
     * Beginning  in the 5.8 release, ModelSim will no longer support SDF
       files  compressed  in  the  Unix  compress  format  (.Z), but will
       support the GNU zip format (.gz). Therefore, ModelSim will read in
       compressed  SDF  files  that are created only with GNU zip (gzip).
       ModelSim does not require the file to have a .gz extension, but it
       will error on files that have a .Z extension.
     * ModelSim's  SystemC  support  has  dependencies  on both operating
       system  version  and  C++  compiler  version.  The  OS  support is
       slightly  different than ModelSim's OS support for designs without
       SystemC  content.  Also,  64-bit  compilation is not supported for
       SystemC designs.
       Supported Operating Systems and C++ compilers:
          + RedHat 7.3 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + RedHat  EWS2.1/7.2  and greater, gcc 3.2.3 (ModelSim 5.8b and
            greater)
          + SunOS 5.6 and greater, gcc 3.2
          + HP-UX 11.0 and greater, aCC 3.45 (with associated patches)
     * ModelSim  LE  does  not  support  VHDL.  However,  it does support
       Verilog and SystemC.
     * CDEBUG compatibility information by platform.
          + On  HP-UX 11.0, ModelSim uses the built-in HP wdb 3.3 program
            as  the  underlying  C/C++  debugger.  In  order  to  run wdb
            successfully,  you must have installed HP-UX PHSS_23842, or a
            superseding   patch.  Without  this  patch  installed,  error
            messages will occur during CDEBUG startup.
          + On  rs6000,  gdb-6.0  works  with gcc-3.2. Additionally, when
            creating  shared  objects, 'ld' (/bin/ld) should be used, not
            'gcc'.  This  combination  works with AIX-5.1. On AIX-5.1 use
            gcc-3.2-aix51.  The native compiler /bin/cc is not compatible
            with gdb-6.0.
     * The vcom compiler default language has been changed from VHDL-1987
       to VHDL-2002. To choose a specific language version:
          + select the appropriate version from the compiler options menu
            in the GUI,
          + invoke vcom using switches -87, -93, or -2002, or
          + set   the   VHDL93   variable   in   the  [vcom]  section  of
            modelsim.ini.
            Appropriate values for VHDL93 are:
               o 0, 87, or 1987 for VHDL-1987;
               o 1, 93, or 1993 for VHDL-1993;
               o 2, 02, or 2002 for VHDL-2002.
     * Although  the  vlog compiler currently supports some SystemVerilog
       features, these extensions are not enabled by default because they
       require  new  language keywords that may conflict with identifiers
       in  existing  code.  There  are  two  ways to enable SystemVerilog
       features  in vlog 5.8c: the first is by using the -sv command line
       option  and  the  second is by naming the source file with a ".sv"
       suffix.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 7.2 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * On  linux only, a Tcl error occurred when the directory from which
       Modelsim was invoked was deleted from the Modelsim command line.
     * The  change  command  did  not  work on objects that were accessed
       through  multiple access types. For example, if S is a record with
       a  field  named  nxt that is an access type to another record, the
       command change s.nxt.field value produced an error.
     * The  user  interface  opened  3  sockets  to  communicate with the
       kernel,  but  only  closed 2 at the end of simulation. If too many
       sockets were opened the simulator hung on some platforms when file
       descriptor limits were exceeded.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * Comparisons  to signed literal constants were not always returning
       expected results (eg. (signed_4bit_variable == 4'b1111) may return
       0 when expecting 1).
     * The  system  function $dist_uniform() was generating an error when
       the  "start"  argument  was  not less than the "end" argument. The
       error  was  changed  to  a  warning  and  the "start" value is now
       returned  in  this  case.  The  behavior  now  compiles  with  the
       Verilog-2001 LRM.
     * Code  coverage  for  Verilog  conditions  and  expressions ignored
       expressions  containing  integer  literals  or  the  '~' operator.
       Warning  messages  were added to the vlog compiler for expressions
       rejected by code coverage.
     * Verilog trigger expressions containing an expression with a system
       function  call  crashed  in  some cases if executed at time 0. For
       example "always @($realtime != 0)" crashed the simulator.
     * A  continuous  assignment referencing a bit-select of a vector net
       on the right-hand side produced incorrect results in some cases if
       that  vector  was  driven  by another continuous assignment with a
       concatenation  as  the  right-hand  side  and  if  the  design was
       compiled with -fast.
     * Module  inlining  with  -fast  did  not  apply  the net delay of a
       dominating net to the collapsed simulation net.
     * A Verilog cell with conditional path delays and optimizes with the
       -fast  option  could  produce  a  spurious  known  value  near the
       beginning of simulation.
     * SDF conditions that were very long (more than 500 characters after
       being  stripped  of  whitespace  and  parentheses)  failed to back
       annotate  due  to  a  string length limitation; the limitation has
       been temporarily doubled and will be re-engineered to be unlimited
       in a future release.
     * Restricting variable declaration assignments to module scope. Vlog
       was  earlier  compiling  it  in  named  block  and  tasks too, and
       generating incorrect results.
     * A  design  having  a  concatenation  connected  to  the port of an
       inlined  module  resulted  in  a compiler crash when compiled with
       -fast  if the port was referenced with bit-selects or part-selects
       in lhs expressions and if the indices were hierarchical references
       or function calls.
     * Bit  vector  slices  used  in  arrays  of  instantiations were not
       indexed correctly for the port connection.
     * Verilog  gate-level  cell  modules  compiled  with  -fast  are not
       compatible between the 5.8c and 5.8d releases of Modelsim. Modules
       compiled  in 5.8c won't simulate in 5.8d and vice versa. (Normally
       we  support upwards compatibility, so 5.8c compiled files *should*
       work  in  a 5.8d simulation.) The 5.8e release correctly simulates
       these  modules regardless of which 5.8x version they were compiled
       in.
     * Implicit  conditions  in $setuphold and $recrem that conflict with
       explicit  conditions  on either a reference or data event were not
       being fully ignored.
     * A sequential UDP latch connected to an RTL latch would immediately
       update its output.
     * A  problem relating to $readmem resulted in memory leaks and large
       load times.
     * In  rare  cases,  the  simulator  crashed  when using designs with
       Verilog generate constructs.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * The PLI function acc_next_bit() had a performance problem.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * Under  certain  conditions  examine/describe/mti_FindVar() crashed
       the  simulator. This occurred when a single architecture was large
       and  contained  subprogram declarations either in the architecture
       or within a process.
     * Under  certain conditions, code coverage was not able to handle an
       expression  for condition or expression coverage. Warning messages
       have been added to vcom for these cases.
     * When  compiling  with  the -87 command-line switch (or VHDL93=0 in
       the  modelsim.ini file), only a warning was produced if a GENERATE
       statement  had  a  declarative  region.  Internal  compiler errors
       resulted  when  there  was  an  attempt  to reference items in the
       declarative  region.  The compiler was modified to report an error
       when there is a non-empty declarative region.
     * Compilation   for   expression   coverage  -cover  e  failed  when
       expression  lengths  were very long. The threshold for failure has
       been doubled, and a future release will allow unlimited lengths.
     * Certain VHDL designs crashed in vsim when code coverage was on and
       condition coverage was enabled.
     * Compiling  with  optimization  level  -O4 or higher produced wrong
       results  for certain cases involving sequential signal assignments
       with   multiple  waveforms  and  constant  values  for  the  first
       waveform.  Compiling  with  optimization level -O1 or lower always
       produced correct results.
     * Evaluation  of CASE statements with more than 4 choices whose case
       expressions are of type bit_vector, in some cases, fail to execute
       the OTHERS choice.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.8e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * In  some  cases  multisource  interconnect  delays were calculated
       incorrectly when all path delays were zero.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * ModelSim's detection of undebuggable SystemC signals and ports has
       been  improved. These signals or ports will simulate correctly but
       may  not be debugged. If ShowUnassociatedNameWarning is enabled in
       the  "modelsim.ini"  file,  ModelSim  issues a warning for each of
       these,  affording  the  user  the opportunity to adjust the source
       code. Otherwise, warnings will not be issued.
     * The  problem  happens  when  a  VHDL module instantiates a SystemC
       module  and the SystemC module name is not lower-cased. The result
       is that vcom cannot load the SystemC design unit.
     * The  waveform  viewer  in  post-simulation  was  showing  internal
       SystemC primitive channels with the mode field as "In".
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PSL Defects Repaired in 5.8e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * A  multisource  interconnect delay in a mixed language design that
       traversed  multiple  levels of hierarchy gave incorrect results in
       certain cases.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.8e
     * In  some cases, when GUI windows were manipulated in the middle of
       code  coverage session, the coverage data was not update correctly
       at the end of a simulation run.
     * An  error  occurred  while viewing the memory contents inside VHDL
       packages.
     * vcover merge reports the following error message while merging two
       coverage database files:
       Bad  pointer/access  type passed to memory subsystem. "Pointer may
       have  been  previously deallocated.(vlib-5) ****** Memory failure.
       *****".
     * Microsoft  documents a list of illegal file names that are Windows
       device  drivers. If illegal names are included in the work library
       for  module  names, entity names, or architectures we change these
       to  legal  names. For this release we extended the list of illegal
       names  that  we  recognize  to  include  the  complete  list  that
       Microsoft documents. We do this mapping on all platforms to create
       a  portable  library format. This mapping is not customer visible,
       except  that  prior  to  5.8e  a  valid  module name would fail to
       compile on Windows due to matching an illegal Windows file name.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.8e
     * DR  00204197  -  Modelsim crash when selecting a SystemC object in
       the Structure window
     * DR 00199342 - Sequential UDP updating the output immediately.
     * DR 00208362 - -coverage causes crash with "Bad Pointer Access".
     * DR  00205088 - Incorrect sim results for 5.8 optimized simulation,
       worked in 5.7.
     * DR 00208732 - vcom errors with -cover option.
     * DR 00211064 - Wrong SDR error with option +delayed_timing_checks.
     * DR  00208083  -  X  inputs caused 0/1 to be observed for primitive
       gates.
     * DR 00203919 - Crashing issue with mti_FindVar.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Known Defects in 5.8e
     * When  you  are  creating  a  code  coverage  exclusion  file,  the
       filenames  you  enter  must use the same paths that were given for
       the file to vcom or vlog. Otherwise you will get an error:
       **  Warning: (vsim-3684) File '/u/xx/src/test.vhd' has no coverage
       data associated with it.
     * Toggle  coverage  currently  counts  zero-delay  glitches as valid
       toggle data.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Product Changes to 5.8e
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.8e
     * The  vsim invocation option -g no longer truncates the given value
       to 32 bits. For example -g"p=40'hffff0000xx" will now properly set
       a Verilog parameter 'p' to a 40-bit value.
