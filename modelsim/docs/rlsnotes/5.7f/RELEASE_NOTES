   ______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The following platform will be discontinued as of the ModelSim 5.8
       release:
          + AIX 4.2
     * You  must  recompile  or  refresh  your  models  if you are moving
       forward  from  5.7  Betas or 5.6x or earlier release versions. See
       "Regenerating your Libraries" in the ModelSim Start Here Guide for
       more information on refreshing your models.
     * Acrobat  reader  version  4.0  or greater must be used to read any
       .pdf file contained in ModelSim version 5.5c or greater.
     * Product  changes and new features mentioned here are introduced in
       the  5.7f  release.  If you are migrating to the 5.7f release from
       5.6x or earlier releases, please also consult version 5.7x release
       notes  for  product changes and new features introduced during the
       5.7  patch  releases.  The  previous  version release notes can be
       found in your modeltech installation directory at docs/rlsnotes.
     * The HP-UX 10.20 platform is no longer supported as of the ModelSim
       5.7  release.  The  hp700  platform executables are built on HP-UX
       11.0. Please note that in order for FLI/PLI shared libraries to be
       loaded  and  executed correctly by the hp700 version of vsim, they
       must be compiled and linked on HP-UX 11.0.
     * Beginning  with  the  5.6  release  (on  Windows  platforms only),
       attempts  to  link  in libvsim.lib or tk83.lib using the Microsoft
       Visual  C++ linker version 5.0 will fail with a message similar to
       "Invalid  file  or disk full: cannot seek to 0xaa77b00". Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 6.0 should be used.
     * In  the next major release, the linux platform executables will be
       built  on  RedHat  Enterprise  Workstation  2.1.  This  version is
       compatible with RedHat 7.2 and higher. RedHat 6.0 through 7.1 will
       be supported for one release with a new platform vco.
     * The following lists the supported platforms:
          + win32aloem - Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP
          + sunos5aloem - Solaris 2.6, 7, 8
          + hp700aloem - HP-UX 11
          + linuxaloem - RedHat 6.0 and higher.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * The  virtual save command did not include the -delay option in the
       generated  .do  file  and  it  incorrectly  generated  the list of
       signals included in delayed virtual signals.
     * In Modelsim PE, the Main window Tools > Options menu did not work.
       For  example, if you tried to change the VSIM prompt or Transcript
       File parameters, it did not work.
     * When using the Find dialog in the Source window, the matching item
       did not highlight unless the dialog box was closed.
     * The  List  window  failed  to  update  if  a gating expression was
       applied  in a macro file specified on the command line. The window
       updated  properly  if  the  macro  file  was  executed at the VSIM
       prompt.
     * The performance of ModelSim's user interface was degraded for each
       selection  of  the  'Compile Selected', 'Compile All', or 'Compile
       Out-Of-Date'  menu items in a project containing a large number of
       files.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Verilog Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * $fscanf can now write to a memory element.
     * $setuphold  did  not  report  all  the timing violations that were
       reported  by  the  equivalent  $setup  and  $hold timing checks. A
       similar   situation   existed  with  $recrem  and  the  equivalent
       $recovery  and  $removal  timing  checks.  Also,  some  $setup and
       $removal  errors were not reported if the reference event occurred
       multiple times in the violation window.
     * Pulse  filtering  problems  caused  events  to be scheduled in the
       past. This occurred when pulses appeared at a path input without a
       path  delay  specified,  and the path output was included in other
       paths with specified delays.
     * vlog  allowed inout ports declared using the new ANSI-style syntax
       to be re-declared. This now reports an error.
     * The options +nowarnFOFIR and +nowarnFOFIA for suppressing warnings
       from the $fopen() system task had no effect.
     * Path  pulse  errors  were not detected on transitions to X while a
       previous  pulse  error  was  pending  for  a  transition from X to
       another value. This behavior occurred only when not compiling with
       -fast.
     * In   some   cases   sign-extension  was  not  being  performed  in
       expressions involving elements of signed arrays.
     * A force statement involving feedback did not behave as expected.
     * The simulator crashed when externally referencing net arrays.
     * Unconnected  ports  with  $width  or $period timing checks in some
       cases caused a crash during SDF annotation.
     * The  -optcells  option  of the add wave command did not work under
       some conditions.
     * An  optimized  cell with multisource interconnect delays, where at
       least  one of the delays was not annotated, in some cases selected
       the wrong delay or crashed.
     * Mixed  designs  containing  Verilog generate constructs crashed in
       some cases.
     * Localparams  could  be overridden with ordered inherited parameter
       instantiation.   Now   localparams  will  be  ignored  by  ordered
       parameters.
     * When using the -fast or +opt switch, VHDL configurations could not
       be referenced from Verilog design units.
     * Compiling  a  design  that  contained  unreferenced functions with
       -fast resulted in an internal compiler error in some cases.
     * A  design  containing system function calls that was compiled with
       -fast  produced  incorrect  results in some cases depending on the
       optimizations that were applied.
     * A design using the "list of instances" syntax hung the compiler if
       a  parameter  value  was  passed down in the instantiations and if
       compiled with -fast.
     * Compiling  a design containing an array of vector nets resulted in
       an  internal  compiler error if compiled with -fast and if the net
       had no drivers.
     * Optimization interactions when compiling a design with -fast could
       result  in  incorrect  evaluation  of  ternary  and  bitwise infix
       expressions  in  some  unusual cases if the operand widths did not
       match each other.
     * If   a   Verilog   design  failed  to  elaborate  with  unresolved
       hierarchical references and the design was elaborated again and it
       still  had unresolved hierarchical references, the simulator could
       crash.
     * $fwrite()  wrote  all  zeroes  for %u and %z formats when compiled
       with -fast.
     * $fwrite  ignored multi-channel descriptors when formatting with %u
       and %z.
     * Some  output  path  delays  with  transitions to/from X were being
       scheduled  with  the  wrong  delay  value  for  an  optimized cell
       containing tristate gate primitives.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   PLI Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * When  comparing a handle to an object obtained from an iterator to
       a  handle  to the same object obtained from a system task/function
       argument, vpi_compare_objects() always returned FALSE.
     * vpi_put_value() now supports strength values.
     * The   ability   to  return  handles  to  VHDL  architectures  from
       vpi_handle_by_name() had accidentally been turned off.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * vcom  previously  allowed  a  generate  statement  without a BEGIN
       keyword   between   the   declarative  items  and  the  concurrent
       statements.  Now  a  warning  message  is  issued,  since  this is
       technically illegal VHDL.
     * When  a  VHDL  entity  with an unconstrained port was instantiated
       with  a  conversion  function  connecting the actual to the formal
       port, the simulation crashed.
     * There was a problem with vcom label expression parsing.
     * In  some  cases  the simulator generated bad code and crashed when
       merging  processes  together. This occurred when a record or array
       signal  was  partially  assigned  to  and  some of the assignments
       occurred within a FOR or WHILE loop.
     * SDF  Interconnect  Delays  from  an  indexed  bus  port to another
       indexed  bus  port  would  give  an  incorrect error message about
       expecting a negative generic array size.

   FLI Defects Repaired in 5.7f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   VITAL Defects Repaired in 5.7f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * When  setting  a VHDL generic of type time from Verilog, the value
       wasn't scaled to the current timescale.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 5.7f
     * v2k_int_delays  functionality did not correctly handle unconnected
       ports.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   Mentor Graphics DRs Repaired in 5.7f
     * DR  00141151  -  Added information to error message to advise user
       that  most  likely  cause is incorrectly set licensing environment
       variable.
     * DR 00140556 - VPI: bug with vpi_compare_objects function.
     * DR  00146869  -  The VHDL procedure modelsim_lib.util.signal_force
       sometimes  failed  or  crashed  when  called multiple times with a
       string   literal   actual   for   the   second   argument  (formal
       "force_value").
     * DR  00141981  - Incorrect handling of tri-state buffer bufif0 with
       -fast.
     * DR  00141412  -  Running vsim using +multisource_int_delays option
       aborts when loading design and sdf file.
     * DR  00140217  -  Location  map  variables  in library mappings not
       working.
     * DR  00139846  -  `timescale  not  considered  for  generic on VHDL
       instances.
     * DR  00139494  -  Invalid  error  on  Verilog 2001 re-definition of
       ports.

   Known Defects in 5.7f
     * Designs  compiled  under  ModelSim  5.7e  containing  indexed part
       selects  of net arrays (eg. net_array[1+:4]) in some cases produce
       an error when simulated under ModelSim 5.7f:
       #   **   Fatal:   (vsim-3377)   Invalid   part-select  expression:
       'net_array'.
       In this case a re-compile under ModelSim 5.7f will be necessary to
       resolve the error(s).

   Product Changes to 5.7f
   ______________________________________________________________________

   New Features Added to 5.7f
     * Verilog cells containing bufif0, bufif1, notif0, and notif1 output
       drivers now optimize.
