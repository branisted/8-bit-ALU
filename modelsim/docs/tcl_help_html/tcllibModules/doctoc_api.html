<p>
<p> doctoc_api - Interface specification for toc formatting code



<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>
<p>


This manpage specifies the interface between formatting engines for
data in the <strong>doctoc</strong> format as specified in
<strong>doctoc_fmt</strong>, and <strong>doctools::toc</strong>, the package for the
generic handling of such data, as described in <strong>doctoc</strong>.

<p>

Each formatting engine has to implement the conversion of input in
<strong>doctoc</strong> format to one particular output format as chosen by
the author of the formatting engine.

<h2><a name="interface">INTERFACE</a></h2>
<p>

Each formatting engine has to provide

<ol>
<li>

Implementations of all the formatting commands as specified in

<strong>doctoc_fmt</strong>, using the defined names, but prefixed with the
string <strong>fmt_</strong>. The sole exceptions to this are the formatting
commands <b class='cmd'>vset</b> and <b class='cmd'>include</b>. These two commands are
processed by the generic layer and will never be seen by the
formatting engine.

<br><br>
<li>
and additionally implementations for

<br><br>
<dl>

<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_numpasses</b><dd>

This command is called immediately after the formatter is loaded and
has to return the number of passes required by this formatter to
process a manpage. This information has to be an integer number
greater or equal to one.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_initialize</b><dd>

This command is called at the beginning of every conversion run and is
responsible for initializing the general state of the formatting
engine.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_setup</b> <i class='arg'>n</i><dd>

This command is called at the beginning of each pass over the input
and is given the id of the current pass as its first argument. It is
responsible for setting up the internal state of the formatting for
this particular pass.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_postprocess</b> <i class='arg'>text</i><dd>

This command is called immediately after the last pass, with the
expansion result of that pass as argument, and can do any last-ditch
modifications of the generated result.  Its result will be the final
result of the conversion.

<br><br>

Most formats will use <em>identity</em> here.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_shutdown</b><dd>

This command is called at the end of every conversion run and is
responsible for cleaning up of all the state in the formatting engine.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>fmt_plain_text</b> <i class='arg'>text</i><dd>

This command is called for any plain text encountered by the processor
in the input and can do any special processing required for plain
text. Its result is the string written into the expansion.

<br><br>

Most formats will use <em>identity</em> here.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_listvariables</b><dd>

The command is called after loading a formatting engine to determine
which parameters are supported by that engine. The return value is a
list containing the names of these parameters.

<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>toc_varset</b> <i class='arg'>varname</i> <i class='arg'>text</i><dd>

The command is called by the generic layer to set the value of an
engine specific parameter. The parameter to change is specified by
<i class='arg'>varname</i>, and the value to set is given in <i class='arg'>text</i>.

<br><br>

The command will throw an error if an unknown <i class='arg'>varname</i> is
used. Only the names returned by <b class='cmd'>toc_listvariables</b> are
considered known.

</dl>
</ol>

<p>

The tcl code of a formatting engine implementing all of the above can
make the following assumptions about its environment

<ol>
<li>

It has full access to its own safe interpreter.  In other words, the
engine cannot damage the other parts of the processor, nor can it
damage the filesystem.

<br><br>
<li>

The surrounding system provides the engine with the following
commands:

<br><br>
<dl>

<dt>Doctools commands<dd>
<dl>
<dt><b class='cmd'>dt_format</b><dd>
Returns the name of format loaded into the engine
<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>dt_fmap</b> <i class='arg'>fname</i><dd>
Returns the actual name to use in the output in place of the symbolic
filename <i class='arg'>fname</i>.
<br><br>
<dt><b class='cmd'>dt_source</b> <i class='arg'>file</i><dd>
This command allows the engine to load additional tcl code. The file
being loaded has to be in the same directory as the file the format
engine was loaded from. Any path specified for <i class='arg'>file</i> is ignored.
</dl>

<dt>Expander commands<dd>

All of the commands below are methods of the expander object (without
the prefix <strong>ex_</strong>) handling the input. Their arguments and
results are described in <strong>expander(n)</strong>.


<br><br>
<dl>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cappend</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cget</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cis</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cname</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cpop</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cpush</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_cset</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_lb</b><dd>
<dt><b class='cmd'>ex_rb</b><dd>
</dl>

<dt>_toc_common.tcl commands<dd>

Any engine loading (<b class='cmd'>dt_source</b>) the file &quot;<strong>_toc_common.tcl</strong>&quot; has
default implementations of the <strong>toc_</strong> commands explicitly
listed in this document and of <b class='cmd'>fmt_plaint_text</b>.
