December 3, 2008

-------------------------

** Bugs Fixed:

  - OVM factory registrations have been added for ovm_random_stimulus,
    ovm_in_order_comparator, ovm_algorithmic_comparator, and
    ovm_subscriber.

  - Fixed bug where unpack_field returned an incorrect x before actual
    value.

  - Fixed inconsistent use of inst_path in ovm_factory.

  - Fixed bug so that phases can now be inserted during build phase.

  - Added deprecation warning messages for all deprecated features 
    (see deprecated.txt file for list of deprecated features).

    Here is the list of deprecated features which will now emit warning
    messages if they are used:

        ovm_component::find_component
        ovm_component::find_components
        ovm_component::get_component

        ovm_sequence_item::set_parent_seq
        ovm_sequence_item::get_parent_seq

  - Added missing "static" keyword in ovm_component_registry_param macro.

  - Added a check in ovm_sequencer.svh to check that sequence_id is not
    -1, which indicates that set_id_info was not called.

  - Added error report if a sequence calls send_request() without first
    having called wait_for_grant().

  - Fixed ovm_file and ovm_line macros for Questa and IUS.

  - The +OVM_VERBOSITY command line option now properly sets the
    verbosity threshold in the report server.

    The command line syntax is: +<verbosity_flag>=<verbosity_value>

    <verbosity_flag> = OVM_VERBOSITY | ovm_verbosity | VERBOSITY | verbosity

    <verbosity_value = OVM_NONE | NONE | OVM_LOW | LOW | LO 
                     | OVM_MEDIUM | OVM_MED | MEDIUM | MED
                     | OVM_HIGH | OVM_HI | HIGH | HI | OVM_FULL
                     | FULL | OVM_DEBUG | DEBUG
                     | <verbosity_level>

    <verbosity_level> = integer >= 0 

  - The scenario compatibility layer default parameterization has been
    fixed to match sequences.

  - Some verbosity values in the urm compatibility were corrected.

  - The verbosity values in ovm_comparer were fixed.

  - Fixed `ovm_update_seq_and_lib so that it uses
    create_inst_override_by_type.

  - Moved all tlm defines to tlm_defines.svh file so that external use
    of *_decl macros now works properly.

  - fixed broken _decl macros

  - Removed use of '-' in format specifiers in ovm_report_handler.

  - Fixed user defined phases to allow use from different class
    hierarchies.

  - Fixed bug so that sequence kill now works properly.

  - Constructor for component registry has been fixed to use positional
    rather than named arguments for function calls.

  - Fixed code in ovm_object and macros so that ABSTRACT flag now works
    properly.

  - Fixed bug so that wait_for_sequence_state() now wakes up during the
    correct state.

  - Made a performance optimization in ovm_report_server to not call
    $swrite when not needed.

  - Fixed the internal buffer within ovm_packer to allow more than 4096
    total bits.

  - Fixed ovm_version strings to be constant parameters.

  - Fixed radix for comparison in field arrays.

  - Fixed default verbosity in urm compatibility area to OVM_MEDIUM to
    be consistent with previous default.

  - Fixed binding defines in urm compatibility area.

  - Added check to emit error in ovm_sequence_item::start_item when the
    sequencer is null.

  - Fixed bug so that grab followed by ungrab from a virtual sequence
    will now properly process items.

  - Improved error messages from the OVM library when doing a sequence
    on the wrong type of sequencer.

  - Fixed issue so that connect_if() can now be used for
    sequencer.seq_item_cons_if for backwards compatibility (note that
    connect_if() is deprecated still).

  - Added get_arbitration() function to ovm_sequencer_base.svh.

  - Fixed bug so that it is now possible to do items from virtual
    sequences on driver sequencers.

  - Fixed bug in which global timeout was printed in hex for questa
    (instead of %t).

  - Fixed bug in ovm_packer in which index error messages gave incorrect
    "valid range".

  - Fixed bug in ovm_object::pack_ints & unpack_ints in which they
    corrupted data.

  - Removed dead code in ovm_packer::put_bits.

  - Fixed bug in ovm_object::pack_ints.

  - Fixed bug in which parallel `ovm_do_on or wait_for_grant calls would
    fail.

  - Fixed bug were sequence priority was not passed correctly from
    built-in sequences.

  - Fixed bug so push_sequencer creates built-in sequences and starts
    default sequence the same way as the pull sequencer.

  - Fixed bug so that inheritance hierarchy of sequences all have access
    to p_sequencer in sequences with multiple inheritances.

  - Removed `ovm_sequence_param_utils macro.  This macro did not function
    correctly, and could give erroneous results.

      To use parameterized sequences in sequence libraries, wrap them in
      a non-parameterized class.

  - Sequencer calls get_config in both new and build routines to allow
    setting of default sequence in build phase to work.

  - _global_reporter is now aliased to ovm_top.  This is part of the
    process of deprecating _global_reporter.

  - modified the reporting interface in ovm_report_object by adding the
    following functions:

      function int get_report_verbosity_level();
      function int get_report_action(ovm_severity severity, string id);
      function int get_report_file_handle(ovm_severity severity, string id);
      function int ovm_report_enabled(int verbosity);

  - Added the global function ovm_report_enabled(int verbosity).  This
    function checks to see if, given the supplied verbosity, whether or
    not a report will print.  It will be used in future releases of OVM
    to determine if a report will be issued before undertaking the
    report processing.

Release Notes for OVM-2.0
August 5, 2008

-------------------------

** Unified sequences

  The new unified sequences facility unifies the ideas in the scenarios
  and sequences facilities in OVM-1.1.  The new facility draws from both
  scenarios and sequences to provide a complete stimulus generation
  capability.

  >> sequences

  - Sequences are parameterized with request and response types.  The
    response type defaults to that of the request.

  >> sequence items

  - Sequence items now contain id to enable routing of responses back to
    the sequence from which the corresponding request originated.

  >> sequencer

  - Sequencers, like sequences are now parameterized request and
    response types. The default type for the response is that of the
    request.  

  - A sequencer can route a response back to it the sequence that
    initiated the request.

  - Sequences can be prioritized and executed based on their priority.
    The sequencer manages the arbitration.

  - Push-mode sequencers are available to connect sequences to push-mode
    drivers.

  >> sequencer/driver API
 
  - The sequencer/driver API consists of the following tasks and
    functions:

    has_do_available()
    wait_for_sequences()
    get_next_item()
    try_next_item()
    item_done()
    put()
    get()
    peek()

  - The driver and sequencer are connected using a port and export.  A
    custom port interface provides the necessary tasks and functions
    that drivers use to access the services provided by sequences and
    sequencers.  These are all accessible via the ovm_sqr_pull_if.  This
    interface is bound using the ovm_seq_item_pull_port and _export.
    The sequencer supplies the export to which the driver with the
    corresponding port connects.  The sequencer and driver are bound
    using the usual port connect() function.

  >> sequence/sequencer API

    The sequencer supplies the following set of tasks and functions for
    sequences to interact with it:

    wait_for_grant()
    lock()
    unlock()
    grab()
    ungrab()
    is_grabbed()
    send_request()
    get_response()

    This collection of tasks and functions provides for the complete
    interaction with the sequencer to enable late randomization along
    with all the other features of sequences.  A collect of `ovm_do_-
    macros is also availale as a convenience layer and also to enable
    in-line constraints.

    Lock differs only slightly from grab.  Grab causes the grabbing
    sequence to immediatly jump to the head of the queue to be serviced
    next by the driver.  Lock leaves the sequence in the same place in
    the queue and the lock takes effect when the sequence reaches the
    head of the queue.

** Factory

  Support for parameterized classes.  This is accomplished by allowing
  object handles to be used as keys as well as strings.

** Reorganize ovm_port and related classes

    The organization of the ovm_port_base class and associated helper
    classes has been simplified.  There are no implications for users
    or existing user code.

    We retain the dual-class nature of the OVM port for backward
    compatibility reasons: both ovm_component and ovm_port_base define a
    connect( ) method with conflicting prototypes and semantics. Having
    ovm_port_base inherit from ovm_component was not an option.  The new
    port infrastructure is fully implemented in a single file,
    ovm_port_base.svh. Additionally, the TLM port, export, and imp
    specializations in the tlm/ directory were updated to reflect the
    new port hierarchy and optimized for code reduction.

** Port connectivity API

    Ovm_port has two functions, get_connected_to and get_provided_to,
    each of which returns a list of ports.  This enables users to write
    code that traverses the connectivity of a design.

** Collapse ovm_threaded_component and ovm_component

    The functionality previously in ovm_threaded_component has now been
    moved to ovm_component.  Ovm_threaded_component remains as a typedef
    of ovm_component for backward compatibility.

** Added banners in run_test()

    Run_test() now produces a banner when it starts and a message
    summary when it completes.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - avm_analysis_imp is now present in in AVM backward compatibility.

  - typo in tlm_req_rsp.svh fixed

  - segfault in Questa in ovm_factory::print_override_info() has been
    fixed.

  - Previously, back-to-back task phases did not operate correctly.
    This has been fixed.

  - URM command line processor has been `ifdef'ed so now it is only
    present in IUS simulations.

Release Notes for OVM-1.1
April 1, 2008

-------------------------

** Singleton top

Created a new class, ovm_root, with a singleton instance named
ovm_top.  This object serves as common top-level for component
hierarchies rooted in different modules and it allows many items that
were in global space to be moved to non-static members of ovm_root.
Further, this serves as a centralized phase/process control; all phsae
control is done in a single place instead of distributed amongst
components in the hierachy.

** Phase changes

  - Moved most functionality to ovm_root class.  This results in a
    simpler implemtation requiring less code which is more robust.  Now
    there is no local component state for phases other than current
    phase handle and phase-related methods in ovm_component have been
    reduced to two

  - Phase objects are shared globally

  - Phase comparison is done using object handles, not string names.

  - The set of phases has changed, with new phases added and old ones
    deprecated.

    build
    post_new (deprecated)
    export_connections (deprecated)
    connect
    import_connections (deprecated)
    configure (deprecated)
    end_of_elaboration
    start_of_simulation
    pre_run (deprecated)
    run
    extract
    check
    report

       as 'connect'
    
    methodology/sequences/ovm_sequencer_base.sv
    
       Removed 'run_forever'; not needed any longer, as run task will no
       longer be killed upon return. Only a kill or stop_request cann
       kill processes forked from the run task.



** Miscellaneous Fixes    

  - Corrected problem where connect-time checks were not properly
    identifying illegal connectionsin analysis port.  The correction was
    made by inserting a call to super.connect() in
    ovm_analysis_port::connect().

  - Fix ovm_component::get_name(). This function was returning the full
    instance name instead of the leaf name.

  - Add timeunit to phase timeouts so that the timeout is not dependent
    on the user's timescale.

  - Fix formatting for string values in table. When truncated, one too
    few charcters were displayed.

  - IUS does not support multiple format strings for $psprintf. Messages
    using multiple format strings were changed to use a single format
    string.

  - Fix bug in URM message compatibility that caused `dut_error to
    always exit (removed automatic OVM_EXIT action).

  - Add command line option OVM_SEVERITY for consistency with other
    command line options.

  - Fix tlm_fifo bug around thread safety (multiple gets in same time
    slice caused incorrect results).

  - Add support of one-dimensional static arrays using
    `ovm_field_sarray_*.

  - Removed assertion from phase cast to allow mixing hierarchy.

  - Provide a non_blocking option for ovm_scenario_driver
    get_next_item() call.

  - Macros `apply_with and `apply_send_with allow for randomize with
    parameters.

  - Optional no_randomize argument added to ovm_scenario apply calls.
