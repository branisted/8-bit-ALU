Recording Transactions using the OVM
------------------------------------

The OVM contains "hooks" for transaction recording,
and these hooks have been populated with calls to the
Questa Transaction Recording PLI calls. If you are
interested in the details, you can find the implementation
in the file src/base/tr_hooks.sv in the OVM distribution.

These hooks are only implemented in the OVM kit that
is distributed with Questa. They are not implemented
in the OVM version distributed on OVM World.

If you want to record transactions, you either need to
use the built-in, pre-compiled OVM distributed with
Questa, or you need to compile the source code
of the OVM distributed with Questa.

In order to compile the OVM distributed with
Questa, you should do something like:

  vlog +incdir+$OVM_HOME/src $OVM_HOME/src/ovm_pkg.sv

where OVM_HOME points into your Questa installation tree.

In a linux csh, for example:

  setenv OVM_HOME $MTI_HOME/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/
  vlog +incdir+$OVM_HOME/src $OVM_HOME/src/ovm_pkg.sv

On my windows cygwin:

  setenv OVM_HOME c:/QuestaSim_6.5/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/
  vlog +incdir+$OVM_HOME/src $OVM_HOME/src/ovm_pkg.sv

From a DOS prompt:

 set OVM_HOME=c:\QuestaSim_6.5\verilog_src\ovm-2.0.1
 vlog +incdir+%OVM_HOME%/src %OVM_HOME%/src/ovm_pkg.sv


This transaction recording implementation is BETA.

Please report all problems and issues to vm_support@mentor.com


----------------------------------------------------------
Questa Versions

This code runs on 6.4b and later, and 6.5 and later.
It is generally best to run transaction recording on the
latest release possible.

  6.4b/questasim/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/src/base/tr_hooks.sv
  6.4c/questasim/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/src/base/tr_hooks.sv
  6.5/questasim/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/src/base/tr_hooks.sv

Transaction recording is only available using OVM 2.0.1

----------------------------------------------------------
Turning on transaction recording

  To use the transaction recording system, you must
  first "enable recording":
  
    set_config_int("*", "recording_detail", 1)
  
  This turns on recording. 

----------------------------------------------------------
Examples - General

  Transaction recording examples are bundled with this
  special release. It is undecided how they will be
  bundled in the official release.

  Run the examples either with 'run_questa' or the makefile.

  See 
    examples/transaction_recording/simple
    examples/transaction_recording/simple_module
    examples/transaction_recording/simple_memory

----------------------------------------------------------
Examples - Using Field Automation

  If you are using field automation macros then your code 
  will automatically record transactions.
  
  See examples/transaction_recording/simple for such an example.
  
----------------------------------------------------------
Examples - Direct calls

  You can also call the OVM transaction recording API directly,
  although this is not recommended.
  
  See examples/transaction_recording/simple_module for 
  such an example.

----------------------------------------------------------
Examples - XBUS

  The examples/xbus/example should run as-is, and record
  transactions without any intervention from you.

  On Windows (cygwin):

    cd <KIT>/examples/xbus/examples
    setenv OVM_HOME c:/QuestaSim_6.5
    vlog +incdir+../sv +incdir+$OVM_HOME/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/src xbus_tb_top.sv
    vsim +OVM_TESTNAME=test_read_modify_write -do vsim.do -c -suppress 3829 xbus_tb_top

    questasim -view vsim.wlf
	        add wave -r /*

  On Linux (cygwin):

    cd <KIT>/examples/xbus/examples
    setenv OVM_HOME /u/release/6.5
    vlog +incdir+../sv +incdir+$OVM_HOME/verilog_src/ovm-2.0.1/src xbus_tb_top.sv
    vsim +OVM_TESTNAME=test_read_modify_write -do vsim.do -c -suppress 3829 xbus_tb_top

    vsim -view vsim.wlf
	        add wave -r /*


----------------------------------------------------------
Viewing transactions

  Transactions are viewable during simulation or after.

  One way to view transactions after simulation is

    vsim -view vsim.wlf

  then at the "VSIM>" prompt I do:

    add wave -r /*

  and transactions are displayed.

  Currently, the transaction streams you may see may have
  incorrect or unusual names. This is a bug, and will be
  fixed with a future release.
 
----------------------------------------------------------
Reporting Bugs - and debugging. BETA Code.

  You may identify different kinds of errors in transaction 
  recording:
  
   1) Errors in the thin implementation layer in src/base/tr_hooks.sv
   2) Errors in the PLI $ calls (like $add_attribute())
   3) Errors in the GUI/Waveform drawing.
  
  In order to help you discover problems there are three levels
  of debug in the tr_hooks.sv thin layer. In general they
  print out too much information, but you may find it useful.
  (These debugging aids will be removed or reduced in the official
  release).
  
    vsim \
      +OVM_TR_TRACE_API_DETAIL \
      +OVM_TR_TRACE_PLI_CALLS \
      +OVM_TR_TRACE_API \
      ... test.sv
  
  They are plusargs for vsim.
  
    OVM_TR_TRACE_PLI_CALLS
       - Show lots of detail about how the PLI is being called.
  
    OVM_TR_TRACE_API
       - Show the OVM API as it executes. Like a function
         call trace.
  
    OVM_TR_TRACE_API_DETAIL
       - Show many details about the OVM API as it executes.
         Show the function call trace, and the function call
         arguments.
       - Setting OVM_TR_TRACE_API_DETAIL also turns on
         OVM_TR_TRACE_API.


----------------------------------------------------------
Known problems

  Fixed in Questa 6.4d, 6.5a and later. But still existing in
  OVM 2.0.1 implementation. Fixed in a future OVM release.

    Bug: Streams may have the name "TVM". 
    Bug: Streams are created in a "strange scope", like 
          "/ovm_root::m_do_phase_all/" or
	      "ovm_sequence__2::start/TVM" or 
		  "/xbus_master_monitor::run/TVM"

  Questa 6.4a sometimes reports Errors with the PLI
    registration of components and ports. These errors
    messages can be ignored - the simulation should run
    properly, but a Questa GUI Debug session may not work
    correctly, or may display "missing" components or ports.
    This is fixed in the upcoming 6.4b.
