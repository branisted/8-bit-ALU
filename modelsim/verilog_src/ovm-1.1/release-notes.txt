Release Notes for OVM-1.1
April 1, 2008

-------------------------

** Singleton top

Created a new class, ovm_root, with a singleton instance named
ovm_top.  This object serves as common top-level for component
hierarchies rooted in different modules and it allows many items that
were in global space to be moved to non-static members of ovm_root.
Further, this serves as a centralized phase/process control; all phsae
control is done in a single place instead of distributed amongst
components in the hierachy.

** Phase changes

  - Moved most functionality to ovm_root class.  This results in a
    simpler implemtation requiring less code which is more robust.  Now
    there is no local component state for phases other than current
    phase handle and phase-related methods in ovm_component have been
    reduced to two

  - Phase objects are shared globally

  - Phase comparison is done using object handles, not string names.

  - The set of phases has changed, with new phases added and old ones
    deprecated.

    build
    post_new (deprecated)
    export_connections (deprecated)
    connect
    import_connections (deprecated)
    configure (deprecated)
    end_of_elaboration
    start_of_simulation
    pre_run (deprecated)
    run
    extract
    check
    report

       as 'connect'
    
    methodology/sequences/ovm_sequencer_base.sv
    
       Removed 'run_forever'; not needed any longer, as run task will no
       longer be killed upon return. Only a kill or stop_request cann
       kill processes forked from the run task.



** Miscellaneous Fixes    

  - Corrected problem where connect-time checks were not properly
    identifying illegal connectionsin analysis port.  The correction was
    made by inserting a call to super.connect() in
    ovm_analysis_port::connect().

  - Fix ovm_component::get_name(). This function was returning the full
    instance name instead of the leaf name.

  - Add timeunit to phase timeouts so that the timeout is not dependent
    on the user's timescale.

  - Fix formatting for string values in table. When truncated, one too
    few charcters were displayed.

  - IUS does not support multiple format strings for $psprintf. Messages
    using multiple format strings were changed to use a single format
    string.

  - Fix bug in URM message compatibility that caused `dut_error to
    always exit (removed automatic OVM_EXIT action).

  - Add command line option OVM_SEVERITY for consistency with other
    command line options.

  - Fix tlm_fifo bug around thread safety (multiple gets in same time
    slice caused incorrect results).

  - Add support of one-dimensional static arrays using
    `ovm_field_sarray_*.

  - Removed assertion from phase cast to allow mixing hierarchy.

  - Provide a non_blocking option for ovm_scenario_driver
    get_next_item() call.

  - Macros `apply_with and `apply_send_with allow for randomize with
    parameters.

  - Optional no_randomize argument added to ovm_scenario apply calls.
